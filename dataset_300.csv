"The present study is a history of the DEWEY Decimal Classification.  The first edition of the DDC was published in 1876, the eighteenth edition in 1971, and future editions will continue to appear as needed.  In spite of the DDC's long and healthy life, however, its full story has never been told.  There have been biographies of Dewey that briefly describe his system, but this is the first attempt to provide a detailed history of the work that more than any other has spurred the growth of librarianship in this country and abroad."
"This report is an analysis of 6300 acts of use in 104 technical libraries in the United Kingdom. Library use is only one aspect of the wider pattern of information use.  Information transfer in libraries is restricted to the use of documents.  It takes no account of documents used outside the library, still less of information transferred orally from person to person.  The library acts as a channel in only a proportion of the situations in which information is transferred. Taking technical information transfer as a whole, there is no doubt that this proportion is not the major one.  There are users of technical information - particularly in technology rather than science - who visit libraries rarely if at all, relying on desk collections of handbooks, current periodicals and personal contact with their colleagues and with people in other organizations.  Even regular library users also receive information in other ways."
"The relationships between the organization and control of writings and the organization and control of knowledge and information will inevitably enter our story, for writings contain, along with much else, a great deal of mankind's stock of knowledge and information.  Bibliographical control is a form of power, and if knowledge itself is a form of power, as the familiar slogan claims, bibliographical control is in a certain sense power over power, power to obtain the knowledge recorded in written form.  As writings are not simply, and not in any simple way, storehouses of knowledge, we cannot satisfactorily discuss bibliographical control as simply control over the knowledge and information contained in writings."
"The establishment of nine new universities in the 1960's provoked a highly stimulating re-examination of the nature, purpose and management of academic libraries.  Long-established attitudes and methods were questioned, but although changes were made, the basic difficulty remained - a lack of objective information about the best ways of providing a library service in a university. The report of the UGC Committee on Libraries (the Parry Repot [267]), which, in general, endorsed these changes, also stressed the need for research into all aspects of academic library provision."
"Although the use of games in professional education has become widespread only during the last decade, the method has been used in a number of fields for many hundreds of years. Its origins have been traced to simple war games, used in military training when the ""real thing"" was either unavailable or too dangerous.  In more recent times, these games have become more and more sophisticated, and many now use large electronic computers to handle the complex calculations involved. Since 1956, when the first well-developed management game was introduced, the technique has spread rapidly into a wide variety of disciplines and today it is used at all levels of education, from primary school classes to courses for experienced professional men and women.  One of the main causes of this ""game explosion"" has been the rapid development of sophisticated management techniques, such as simulation and mathematical modelling, which have been made possible by rapid advances in computer technology."
"Graduate library school study of abstracting should be more than a how-to-do-it course. It should include general material on the characteristcs and types of abstracts, the historical development of abstracting publications, the abstract-publishing industry (especially in the United States), and the need for standards in the preparation and evaluation of the product. These topics we call concepts. The text includes a methods section containing instructions for writing various types of abstracts, and for editing and preparing abstracting publications. These detailed instructions are supplemented by examples and exercises in the appendix. There is a brief discussion of indexing of abstract publications. Research on automation has been treated extensively in this work, for we believe that the topic deserves greater emphasis than it has received in the past. Computer use is becoming increasingly important in all aspects of librarianship. Much research effort has been expended on the preparation and evaluation of computer-prepared abstracts and extracts. Students, librarians, and abstractors will benefit from knowing about this research and understanding how computer programs were researched to analyze text, select key sentences, and prepare extracts and abstracts. The benefits of this research are discussed. Abstracting is a key segment of the information industry. Opportunities are available for both full-time professionals and part-time or volunteer workers. Many librarians find such activities pleasant and rewarding, for they know they are contributing to the more effective use of stored information. One chapter is devoted to career opportunities for abstractors."
"This book attempts to present representative examples of successful architectural solutions to the important problems librarians and architects face in planning new college and university library buildings or in remodeling and enlarging existing structures.  It does not attempt to make case study evaluations, as was done by Ellsworth Mason for Brown and Yale.  Nor does it present examples of unsuccessful solutions except to show how to avoid mistakes, and in these cases the libraries will not be identified."
"As important for staff members' individual development as was the apprenticeship in administration, perhaps the most significant attitude one acquired while working for Guy was engendered by his insistence that librarians must be interested in and knowledgeable about the content of the materials with which they dealt.  His love of literature, his respect for scholarship, his admiration for good writing and reading were manifested in many ways, but most notably in his admonition that, though we were primarily a research library, we must constantly keep in mind our obligation to collect contemporary poetry, fiction and belles-letters.  It was primarily up to the library staff, he felt, to be responsible for these as well as for ""general"" books which crossed disciplinary lines or fell between the disciplines, those books which a faculty mostly concerned with research materials is apt to overlook.  And in building this portion of the collection, ""there is no substitute for a thorough acquaintance with books through a reading of critical reviews and the books themselves.""  This counsel is from The President, the Professor, and the College Library, but the importance of its thrust--the need to keep up with the world of books and publishing--was continually impressed upon us."
"This study assumed that an additional use study held less promise than an analytical consideration of concepts. The basic approach was a survey comparing traditional and current professional ideas on direct access.  Principal data-gathering instruments were documentary analysis and opinion questionnaire. Findings of the documentary analysis included the following: Research from 1890 to 1970 on the direct shelf approach and browsing left the problems largely unresolved and evidently resistant to established methods of use and user research.  The need for an exhaustive study of concepts was confirmed. Open shelf libraries--organized through shelf classification and relative location--were meant to arouse the intellectual, social, and political interest of the average citizen and affect his democratic self-realization. Definitions of ""browsing"" varied greatly: self-indulgence by the untutored in objectionable works; beneficial self-education for the general reader; valuable guidance for the scholar in his research."
"The purpose of this study was to develop, evaluate, and recommend a national plan  for improving access to periodical resources.  About 48 percent of all academic interlibrary loans are for periodical materials, with the bulk of the loans being satisfied in the form of photocopies.  A major consideration in the long-range improvement of the interlibrary loan system is the possible augmentation with a national system for acquiring, storing, and satisfying loan requests for periodical materials. This study focused on the physical access to the periodical literature.  Based on the needs of the library community, design features were developed, and included the following: Service should be made available to all users without any restriction other than access through a library. Initially, the service should be confined primarily to rapid, dependable delivery of photocopies of journal articles. The collection of a center should be comprehensive in subject coverage excluding only medicine. All worthwhile journals should be collected irrespective of language."
"The scope of acquisitions work, outlined in the Introduction, acknowledges the importance of selection policy, serials recording, and other topics kindred to acquisitions. These topics are discussed in this book only as they relate to obtaining library materials.  They are examined thoroughly in books and papers that are cited in the references and the bibliographic note. Centralized acquisitions and automation of order routines are of major importance in order work and they are reviewed as chapters in this book.  These chapters are introductions to the concepts and problems of centralization and automation, not manuals of practice. For treatment of these topics in particular and in depth the reader is referred to the references cited.  For automation these references are only a modest selection from an enormous literature."
"The Ligue des bibliotheques europeennes de recherche (LIBER) was set up in 1971 as an international non-governmental organization, with the aim of establishing close collaboration between the general research libraries of Western Europe, particularly national and university libraries, and in particular to help in finding practical ways of improving the quality of the services these libraries provide. At the second meeting of its General Assembly, held in Luxembourg in 1972, LIBER decided to hold a seminar on the acquisition of materials from the 'Third World'; and I was charged with the 'intellectual organization' of this seminar.  The purpose of the meeting would be to examine the problems of acquisition; the availability of materials in European libraries both for reference and for lending; and the feasibility of setting up a European centre for the collection of such material, to be available for loan.  The provision of bibliographic information, preferable in machine-readable form, was to be a basic consideration, whatever means were proposed for acquiring publications from those areas.  The Council of Europe made a generous grant towards the cost of the seminar which was held at the University of Sussex from 17 to 19 September 1973."
"I am not, nor have I ever pretended to be, an expert on microfiche.  Nevertheless, when I was invited to address the Third Annual Northeastern DDC/Industry Users Conference in Waltham, Massachusetts in April of 1968 I had the temerity to attempt to describe what I as a user would like to have in a fiche reader.  (""Towards a Uniform Federal Report Numbering System and a Cuddly Microfiche Reader--Two Modest Proposals."" Revised September 1968.  AD-669204)"
"If this book has a central thesis, it rests upon the simple but frequently neglected principle that college library service goes beyond the commonly accepted functions of book circulation and storage.  The college library exists, not merely to house and circulate library materials, but to supplement and extend the teaching process with reference service, to afford faculty members library opportunities for improving instruction, and to encourage students to read more and better books.  Administration is essentially a service activity, a tool through which library functions are more fully and efficiently realized. The present work retains most of the material of the first edition, but includes substantial revision in each chapter.  The book was planned not only as a text in the teaching of college library administration but also for independent professional reading.  Because readers have found the footnotes and chapter bibliographies useful for reference purposes, they have been brought up to date and in some cases extended."
"Technical communication patterns in two research and development laboratories were examined using modified sociometric techniques.. The structure of technical communication networks in the two laboratories results from the interaction of both social relations and work structure.. The sociometric ""stars"" in the technical communication network who provide other members of the organization with information either make greater use of individuals outside the organization or read the literature more than other members of the laboratory.."
"This manual is designed to make it possible for any library to change efficiently to the Library of Congress Classification system.  Detailed procedures are outlined which may serve as exact models or as a series of suggested steps which have proven effective in actual use.  Most of the text deals with the necessary criteria for effecting the planning, making the preparations, selecting the tools, and establishing the procedures which are essential for a reclassification project.  Beyond this, considerable attention has been given to many of the problem areas of the LC Classification-series, biography, bibliography, law, PZ3 and PZ4.  In addition, the literature Tables VIIIa and IXa, two of the most frequently used tables throughout the entire class system, have been thoroughly explained and their application illustrated by a series of comprehensive examples.  Since the mechanics, production, and cost of catalogue card copy can significantly affect the flow of books to users, a chapter has been devoted to describing the use of Xerox copying machines in library operations.  Finally, an annotated bibliography of books and articles judged to be helpful in deciding to reclassify is included for those readers who wish to delve more deeply into the tortuous and frustrating 50-year history of the concept of centralized cataloging and classification.  The numbers enclosed in parentheses throughout the text refer to sources in the bibliography which relate to or support the arguments being advanced in any particular case."
"There has long been a need for a continuing series to provide scholarly reviews of the rapidly changing and advancing field of librarianship, a series which would select subjects with particular current significance to the profession and provide an analysis of the advances made through research and practice.  Advances in Librarianship is planned and designed to fill this need.  It will present critical articles and surveys based on the published literature, research in progress, and developments in libraries of all types. Mechanization may appear to be the most obvious of the advancing fronts of librarianship, for automation has caught the enthusiastic support of all librarians who can visualize its potential. Advances in this field will certainly be found in every volume of this series. As the first group of articles in this volume demonstrate, technological change has an obvious and direct implication for libraries, but the problem has been found to be much more complex than the simple inventory problem many experts expected. Advances in Librarianship is dedicated to presenting the realities of automation, assessing where we are, where we are going, and how fast we can hope to get there. ""The Machine and Cataloging"" reviews the current status of the machine-produced book catalog and what lies ahead as we enter the age of MARC. Where business methods have greater applicability, progress is easier, as reported in ""Mechanization of Acquisition Processes."" Even in this area generally acceptable practices and standardization are in the future, not the past. One of the problems of major and immediate importance in computerization of catalog information is that discussed in ""Filing Systems for Computer Manipulation."" This detailed review presents the complexity of the problems and suggests possible solutions. For many years technical service costs have been defended without adequate knowledge of the facts. As automated procedures are proposed, standards are determining costs of traditional operations become essential. The article on standards for such costs shows why the problems have been difficult and reviews the significant advances of the past few years. The school library has widened its dimensions in materials and services much more rapidly than other libraries, as reflected in its new name, the instructional media center. Here, technical change, together with new teaching methods, has made possible major developments in library service in schools as well as for children in the public library. Two articles make clear that what can be done has been demonstrated, and that what remains is to make this the rule rather than the exception. Bibliotherapy is an example of a field in which progress has been slow. Articles which illustrate the potential which systems theory and managerial planning theory have for libraries. The articles on the application of these concepts, which come from research in administration, are provocative and may appear controversial to some. The article on library development in developing countries provides an analysis in depth of our efforts and degree of success in assisting other countries in providing the library service which is so important in the modern world."
"The present contribution does not duplicate previous studies but complements the earlier publications and closes the few gaps that exist in the literature prior to 1966 and after 1971.  Additionally, it is a bold attempt to evaluate critically and objectively the history of the mechanized selective dissemination of information (SDI) as reflected in the literature, from the initial description by Luhn (1958, 1961b, c) to the post-1970 period when the SDI boom began losing ground to the more popular on-line interactive systems.  The review therefore questions and interprets the concept of SDI, its implementation, and its evolution in the light of work performed by many companies, government agencies, universities, societies, and libraries during the last fourteen years."
"In trying to give an account of the statistical properties of language, one is faced with the problem of having to find the common thread which would show the many and multifarious forms of language statistics - embodied in scattered papers written by linguists, philosophers, mathematicians, engineers, each using his own professional idiom as belonging to one great whole: quantitative linguistics. The book stresses the peculiarity of statistics of language structure as against just conventional statistics.  To put the difference between two types of statistics briefly, the latter comprises the methods and parameters of general number statistics as applied, e.g., in Economics and Demography, the former has its own methods and characterising parameters, particularly useful for describing and evaluating language structure.  The idea of statistical linguistics as using concepts and methods of its own, which was adumbrated in the author's ""Language as choice and Chance"", 1956, has now taken definite shape. Of this development I shall try to give a brief account.  In my book, ""Language as Choice and Chance"", the foundation was laid for a truly sensible application of statistics to language by my interpretation of the langue-parole dichotomy as being essentially that between statistical universe and sample."
"Most librarians mark the beginning of modern librarianship from the founding of the American Library Association in 1876 and the appearance on the national library scene of such dynamic and controversial figures as Melvil Dewey and Charles Ammi Cutter. But in doing so, they overlook an extremely significant era in the history of our profession, for the quarter century preceding the 1876 meeting in Philadelphia was one characterized by great advances in the field of American librarianship.  This period of growth was to have considerable influence on the course of library development in America after 1876.  To ignore the third quarter of the nineteenth century is to risk misinterpreting the pivotal post-1876 era, and in this time of reappraisal, it seems particularly appropriate and useful to focus our attention on the years preceding the founding of the American Library Association."
"In this book, Lorenz deals with the evolution of aggression in vertebrates.  He points out that aggressivity is totally different from predation: that it is a biological necessity for defence of territory and for a cornered animal, and that it becomes mixed up with other innate drives, thus leading up towards reduction of intraspecific damage. This, be it noted, is most evident in fiercer social predators like wolves, where escape from the pack is virtually impossible and where co-operation without fighting is necessary for survival; whereas in the non-social but proverbially peaceful dove prevention of escape leads to violent and often fatal attacks on the weaker mate. In a final chapter he advances some suggestion as to how in the human species, where evolution is primarily cultural, and not guided by Darwinian selection in the strict sense, the aggressive drive may be canalized into less dangerous channels. Man has innumerable ways of adaptively ritualizing his behavior, many of them analogous, if not homologous, to those found in animals.  In any event, On Aggression is a fascinating book by a master of his subject."
"This paper is not an official policy statement of the American Library Association nor of the Office for Library Education.  It is simply an exploration, an outline of possibilities for consideration by the profession.  Its purpose is to generate discussion that will lead eventually to a statement of Association policy that the profession will support and make effective. A basic assumption on which the statement rests is this: that the library occupation is much broader than that segment of it which is the library profession, but that the professional segment has responsibility for the definition and supervision of the training and education required by the complete range of activities encompassed by the occupation.  Librarians are not the only persons who work in libraries, but librarians are the ones who are concerned with the advancement and improvement of the library profession.  It follows then that it is the obligation of the professionals to engage actively in the establishment and maintenance of standards and norms governing the preparation of people who work at any level in libraries.  They should define and guide the kinds of preparation most useful at the pre-professional level and not merely the education of those who will hold positions at the level we now call ""professional."""
This project was undertaken because of the high degree of uncertainty among the library staff regarding the extent of the problem of missing books.  The findings of this study gave the Ohio State University libraries concrete evidence as to how many books are missing and indicated the areas in which book losses are the greatest.  These figures also provide information which can be conveyed to the faculty or administration when they voice complaints about the unavailability of library books.  The areas where losses are high also tend to indicate the areas of most frequent use.
"1.  What do we mean by technology and what kind of technological forces are we concerned with? 2.  Why is it important to be concerned with technology in thinking about the future of libraries? 3.  What kinds of technology are particularly important for libraries? 4.  How can this technology be applied today? 5.  What can we foresee for the future, as we move toward the year 2000? 6.  What, if anything, should we do tomorrow to try to get from here to here?"
"As far back as the 1920's, algebra had been accepted as the science studying the properties of sets on which there is defined a particular system of operations.  However up until the forties the overwhelming majority of algebraists were investigating merely a few kinds of algebraic structures.  These were primarily groups, rings and lattices.  The first general theoretical work dealing with arbitrary sets with arbitrary operations is due to G. Birkhoff (1935).  During these same years, A. Tarski published an important paper in which he formulated the basic principles of a theory of sets equipped with a system of relations.  Such sets are now called models.  In contrast to algebra, model theory made abundant use of the apparatus of mathematical logic.  The possibility of making fruitful use of logic not only to study universal algebras but also the more classical parts of algebra such as group theory was discovered by the author in 1936. During the next twenty-five years, it gradually became clear that the theory of universal algebras and model theory are very intimately related despite a certain difference in the nature of their problems.  And it is therefore meaningful to speak of a single theory of algebraic systems dealing with sets on which there is defined a series of operations and relations (algebraic systems). The formal apparatus of the theory is the language of the so-called applied predicate calculus.  Thus the theory can be considered to border on logic and algebra."
"This article discusses the possibility of exploiting the statistics of word co-occurrence in text for purposes of document retrieval. Co-occurrence is defined and related to the mental processes of authors and readers; several means of quantitative measurement of word co-occurrence are then scrutinized.  It is shown that the most strongly co-occurring word pairs, which are therefore ""associated"" in a statistical sense, can be represented in the form of an ""association map.""  The last half of the article presents two modes of use of association maps in literature searching."
"A computer program has been written and used which simulates the several-year operation of an information system and computes estimates of the expected operating costs as well as the amount of equipment and personnel required during that time period.  The program has been used for the analysis of several large systems and has proven itself to be a useful research tool for the study of systems with so many components and interrelated operations that an equivalent manual analysis would be extremely cumbersome and time consuming,and perhaps even impractical. This paper describes this program and shows, as an example, some of the results of a simulation of two of several suggested designs for a specific information system."
"Recently a number of articles, books, and reports dealing with information systems, i.e., document retrieval systems, have advanced the doctrine that such systems are to be evaluated in terms of the degree or percentage of relevancy they provide. Although there seems to be little agreement on what relevance means, and some doubt that it is quantifiable, there is, nevertheless, a growing agreement that a fixed and formal relationship exists between the relevance and the recall performance of any system.  Thus, we will find in the literature both a frankly subjective notion of relevance as reported by individual users, and equations, curves, and mathematical formulations which presumably provide numerical measures of the recall and relevance characteristics of information systems.  This phenomenon of shifting back and forth from an admittedly subjective and non-mathematical term to equations in which the same term is given a mathematical value or a mathematical definition has its ancient parallel in discussions of probability.  One cannot, of course, legislate the meaning of a term.  It all depends, as Alice pointed out, on ""who is master,"" the user or the term.  On the other hand, the use of a single term in the same document to cover two or more distinct meanings, especially when such a usage is designed to secure the acceptance of a doctrine by attributing to it mathematical validity which it does not have, represents a more serious situation than merely careless ambiguity."
"The expression ""satisfying a requester's information need"" is often used, but its meaning is obscure.  The literature on ""information need"" in relation to retrieval suggests three different (though not inconsistent) possible interpretations.  However, each of these interpretations is itself fundamentally unclear. The various obscurities involved are indicated by critical questions, which those who write of information need are invited to answer."
"The rationale is given for creation and maintainance by an information center of a controlled indexing and retrieval vocabulary.. Basic vocabulary principles are (1) use of natural language, (2) development of hospitality to new concepts, (3) provision of adequate cross-referencing, and (4) formatting for easy use.. Terminalogical conventions necessary for development and control of a useful vocabulary are summarized, and the techniques for applying these conventions to construct a thesaurus are described.. Computerized editing techniques and updating techniques are briefly set forth.."
"This is an interim report on continuing studies of library operations at Massachusetts Institute of Technology being made by members of the Institute's Operations Research Project in cooperation with the librarians and library staff.  In this report, which is based on actual observations of on-the-premise use made of the Science Library, various statistics measuring the kind, degree, and intensity of use are tabulated.  In addition there are some suggested measures of effectiveness of the library. A unique outcome of the survey has been the construction and verification of a mathematical model employing probability theory to measure rate and kind of use of library material together with length of stay of library patrons. Such models, characteristic of an operations research approach, give promise of furthering the goal of effective library management and planning."
"A comparison of creative and ""noncreative"" research chemists with respect to the ways in which they use their professional and technical literature.. The creative chemists differ from the ""noncreative"" in that the former read more technical literature on the job, are less reluctant to use literature of greater reading difficulty, are less influenced in their independence of thought, read more extensively and consult more frequently the older material, are more inquisitive and have broader cultural interests.. The findings of the study are believed to be helpful in planning library and information services, in refining future inquiries into the ways in which scientists use recorded information, and in improving tests for the identification of creative ability among chemists.."
A consideration of the analogy between the half-life of radioactive substances and the rate of obsolescence of scientific literature.. The validity of this analogy suggest the possibility of more accurate prognostications concerning the period of time during which scientific literature may by used and hence might help to guide the planning of library collections and technical information services..
A distinction is made between bibliographical indexes for new and past literature based on the willingness of the user to trade perfection for currency.. Indexes giving keywords in their context are proposed as suitable for disseminating new information.. These can be entirely machine-generated and hence kept up-to-date with the current literature.. A compatible coding scheme to identify the indexed documents is also proposed.. In it elements are automatically extracted from the usual identifiers of the document so that the coded identifier yields a maximum of information while remaining susceptible to normal methods of ordering..
"An experiment was conducted to determine which of four types of lexical indicators of content could be utilized best by subjects to determine relevant from irrelevant documents and to answer a set of 100 questions.  The results indicate that there were no major differences between the groups using complete text and abstracts to select relevant documents, but the group utilizing the complete text obtained a significantly higher score on the examination."
"Explores the amount of use of books by categories of borrowers in the Yale Medical Library, with a view to discovering the proportion of the catalogue which should be put in machinable form."
"A quantitative estimate is made of the magnitude of the world's scientific and technical journal literature problem. Using a number of basic sources of statistical information, a composite picture is established to show such things as the total volume, linguistic and national origins, breakdown by subject field, and degree of coverage by the abstracting and indexing services."
"A study of several thousand entries in a classified bibliography of article titles (the Index Medicus) revealed that a large proportion of the title entries contained words identical to or synonymous with words of the corresponding subject heading.  It is inferred that a major part of the bibliography studied could have been compiled by a machine procedure operating on titles alone, provided the machine was supplied with a suitable synonym dictionary."
This report describes the results of automatic processing of a large number of scientific papers according to a rigorously defined criterion of coupling.  The population of papers under study was ordered into groups that satisfy the stated criterion of interrelation. An examination of the papers that constitute the groups shows a high degree of logical correlation.
"Results of the census of the world's scientific and technical serial literature, within the limits defined and based on an examination of published source material from countries throughout the world, reflect a total title population much lower than estimated before.. Distribution of this population by country, showing better than 50% of the total divided among six major countries,  is included and discussed, together with a broad subject distribution of serials for certain countries.."
"More than one million citations from the scientific literature have been processed by the Citation Index Project at the Institute for Scientific Information.. The Project, sponsored by NSF and NIH, will be described briefly, and new methods of using citation data for evaluation of publications will be discussed.. Summaries of statistical data, compiled by computer methods such as the following, will be given.. 1. Frequency of citation of one journal by another.. 2. Frequency of current citations to the past literature.. 3. Frequency of self-citation by journals and authors.. 4. Number of source citations per cited paper.. 5. Number of references per source paper.. 6. Number of papers published per journal.."
"Analysis of the problems of defining the mutual relevancies of queries and document-collections indicates that they essentially involve the problem of conceptual relatedness.. In order to consider the later problem, the question of concept-formation is first discussed, which in turn requires a definition of concept.. An extensional interpretation is suggested whereby a concept is associated with a class of conceptually-similar documents.. Users' similarity- judgments then provide the empirical data for formal definitions of concept and conceptual relatedness.. It is found, however, that certain very general difficulties rule out the possibility of defining concepts and their relatedness by the method proposed.. Since this method is based on human relevance-judgments, it seems a natural one to adopt, so that its collapse has serious practical and theoretical consequences.. An alternative approach is therefore proposed whose elaboration will form Part II of this article.."
"A comparison of the ability of humans to consistently judge the relevance of documents to their general interests from bases of citations, abstracts, keywords, and total text was made under controlled experimental conditions.. The results showed that 1) humans are able to make such judgments consistently, and 2) the consistency of the judgment is independent of the particular base from which it is made.. Apparent inconsistency arising from judgments made on the basis of abstracts remains unexplained.. This experiment, as well as others concerned with human evaluations of text material, leave unexplored the basic problem of providing a metric scale on which such evaluations can be measured.."
"A semi-empirical correlation, based on data from nine indexes, permits the prediction of the percentage of terms in a manipulative index vocabulary which will be used to index any given number of documents.. This is a function of the total number of index entries in the system.. A log-normal relationship, similar  to Zipf's Law, exists between total index entries and distribution of term usage.. Based upon the correlation, optimum vocabulary size and growth rate can inferred, as well as the most efficient arrangement of index entries in a storage medium.. The results agree well with published data and appear to be particularly useful for designers of mechanized retrieval or publication operations.."
"Procedures for measuring the consistency of document classification are described.. Three subject specialists classified 997 abstracts of psychological reports into one of eleven categories.. These abstracts were also mechanically classified by a computer program using a factor score computational procedure.. Each abstract was scored for all categories and assigned to the one with the highest score.. The three manual classifications were compared with each other and with the mechanical classifications, and a series of contingency coefficients was computed.. The average reliability of manual classification procedures was equal to .870.. The correlation between automatic and manual classification was .766.."
"The strategy outlined in this article describes a possible aid to the librarian for thinning a library's stack according to the criterion of user needs.. The method uses the last circulation date as a parameter of user circulation requirements.. The resulting stack collection would, by design, satisfy over 99 percent of the user circulation requirements and yet be of minimum size.. Preliminary, but not yet fully validated research, indicates that the number of volumes in a library's holdings may be reduced by 60 to 70 percent and yet satisfy well over 99 percent of the user requirements.. It may also be possible to determine which books should have multiple copies in order that user disappointment can be minimized.. The effective result of this approach is that there now may be a quantitative method of maintaining the library's holdings at a reasonable level and, in addition, a reduction in the disappointment of the user who is unable to find the book he wants because of use by another.."
"Citation indexes to large bodies of science literature can often list far more citing references under the known cited reference than the user can afford the time to look up.. By providing some additional information, beyond the minimal association of the citing reference with the cited reference, a citation index could provide the means of the user to select from a long list those citing references which are most relevant to his immediate search requirement.. Means of providing this selectivity are discussed.. Particular attention is given to the possibility of adding short codes to the citation entries which would be informative of the way in which the citing publication is operationally related to the cited one (this method is an integral feature of the Shepard's legal citations).. A scheme of citation relationships of potential value to users of science literature is presented.. These relationships were tested on a sampling of physics literature.. The suggested categories include indicators of the relation of the citing reference to the scientific process in general, as well as indicators of its relationship to the cited reference in particular.. Assignment of the categories to a citation requires the exercise of judgment, as in subject indexing, but does not involve the use of subject terminology.. An illustration is provided of the application from a citation index to physics literature.."
"The publication explosion has focused renewed attention on the lowly footnote.. While we are all at least partially aware of the technical functions of the citation for both the writer and the reader of the scientific paper, little is known about the norms operating in actual practice.. Even less is known about the operating norms with respect to the more sociological functions, including the acknowledgement of intellectual debts or the conferral of recognition upon the works of others.. This paper reviews the state of our knowledge, raises questions, and proposes suggestions and hypotheses for studying the relationships between footnoting practices among scientists and the social system of science.."
"Computer dissemination of information offers significant advantages over manual dissemination because the computer can use strategies that are impractical and in some cases impossible for a human.. This paper describes the Ames Laboratory Selective Dissemination of Information system with emphasis on the effectiveness of user feedback.. The system will accept any document, abstract, keyword, etc., in a KWIC or Science Citation Index Source format.. User profiles consist of words or word clusters each with an initially assigned significance value.. These values are used in making the decision to notify a user that he may be interested in a particular document.. According to responses, the significance values are increased or decreased and quickly attain an equilibrium which accurately describes the user's interests.. The system is economical compared to other existing SDI systems and human intervention is negligible except for adding and deleting profile entries.."
A detailed comparison of how 334 papers in Volume 112 of Physical Review form related groups according to two criteria of relatedness.. The criteria are: (1) the Analytic Subject Index as used by the editors of the Physical Review; and (2) the method of Bibliographic Coupling.. The similarities and differences between the groups thus formed are illustrated and discussed..
"This report describes a method of indexing documents which is based on the assumptions, (1) that a subset of the words in a document can be an effective index to that document, and (2) that this subject can be approximated by selecting those words from the document whose frequencies are statistically unexpectedly high.. The results of the experiment are encouraging, although not definitive because any index set chosen must be tested by using it for retrieval from a large collection.."
"The original aim of this study was to obtain objective data bearing on the much argued question of whether author indexing is ""good"".. Author indexing of 285 documents reporting biomedical research was scored by comparing the author- supplied terms (author set) for each paper with a criterion set of terms that was  established by asking a group of 12 potential users to describe the same document.. Terms in the document title (title set) were scored similarly.. The average author set contained almost half of all the terms employed by more than one member of the user group and scored 73% of the maximal possible score, as compared with 44% for the average title set.. When judged by the method and criterion employed here, author indexing is substantially better than indexing derived from document titles.. The findings suggest that indicia supplied by an author should serve scientists in biomedical disciplines other than his own about as well as they serve his disciplinary colleagues.. The general method developed for measuring indexing quality may represent a practical yardstick of wide applicability.."
"This paper defines and describes the KWIC (keyword in context) index concept, providing a history of the concept and of its literature.. It discusses variations of the index, such as the Bell Telephone Index, KWOC indexes, and the WADEX.. The paper discusses improvements and variations to the KWIC index, such as manipulation of the index line, variations of the code, addition of classification information, combination of author index and title index, and improvements to the preparation of the KWIC indexes, such as improvement of titles and use of a thesaurus, and discusses improvement of the use of the KWIC index.. The paper discusses the usage of the KWIC index and comments on the future of KWIC indexes of the KWIC concept.."
The evolution described below of one aspect of the NASA system and Technical Information Facility's machine search system may be of general interest to the documentation profession.
Bradford's methods are applied to the Keenan-Atherton data.  The results do not fit Bradford's Law.
"The philosophy, production, and cost-effectiveness of a computer-generated library catalog is described. This catalog is unique in that it utilizes direct computer to microfilm composition techniques, employing the Stromberg Carlson 4020.  Cost, user acceptance, and by-product capabilities are stressed."
A function was developed for the optimum distribution of indexing terms by the number of postings.. This makes it possible to transmit information with maximum efficiency.. The comparison of the actual distribution of the term groups with the calculated optimum distribution provides an objective measure for evaluating any indexing system with respect to its efficiency as information transmission channel..
"Disagreements about the relevance of documents to retrieval requests occur because relevance judges differently interpret requests of documents.. Requests may be differently interpreted because they are unclear.. Well-known types of request obscurity are reviewed.. Less well known is that a request may be unclear because its form - ""documents about subject S"", ""document answering question Q"", etc. - is unclear.. Explications are developed of the meanings of the request forms just given and several others.. A request of any of the forms discussed is interpreted to be for documents which support statements of a specified kind in a specified way.. Examples are given which suggest that some, perhaps all, ""about S"" requests are unclear.. Some ways of formulating clear question requests are given.. Various ways in which documents may support statements are distinguished.. These depend on on such factors as parts of a document use, inference strength, and background knowledge permitted.. Some possible clear support specifications are indicated.."
"Although a large number of Selective Dissemination of Information (SDI) Systems have been planned, implemented, and tested over the past few years, insufficient attention has been given to the collection and interpretation of important data needed for evaluation.. We describe some of the defects common to almost all of the reported systems, single out one recent report for detailed discussion and argue in favor of collection and correct interpretation of data on one important and frequently overlooked evaluation factor.."
"In seeking a new sense of identity, we ask, in this article, the question: What is information science? What does the information science do? Tentative answers to these questions are given in the hope of simulating discussion that will help clarify the nature of our field and our work.."
"A measure of document retrieval system performance called the ""expected search length reduction factor"" is defined and compared with indicators, such as precision and recall, that have been suggested by other workers.. The new measure is based on calculations of the expected number of irrelevant documents in the collection which would have to be searched through before the desired number of relevant documents could be found.. Its advantages are: (1) it provides  a single index of the property it attempts to measure; (2) it allows for gradations of retrieval status, through the mathematical concept of a ""weak ordering""; (3) it evaluates retrieval performance relative to random searching; and (4) it takes into account the amount of relevant material desired by the requester.."
"A principle of sequential optimization in search theory distributes the search effort at each stage so as to maximize the probability of target detection with the effort expended thus far.. As an application of this principle to the search of pertinent items in a literature file, the file items should be arranged in decreasing order of the probability that an item will yield the information sought.. Complete ordering in this manner may not be feasible, and it is proposed that the files be partially ordered in search zones with some loss in search efficiency.. A model for assessing the relative efficiency for partial ordering is developed and used to determine optimal zone sizes under an assumed target distribution pattern.. In this way, trade-off between file organization effort and search effort can be meaningfully evaluated.. A representative target distribution function for search literature appears to follow the Bradford law of scattering.. This function is used to demonstrate the application of the model over a meaningful range of parameters obtained from empirical studies.. It is shown that a good two-zone search plan to scientific literature is one in which 15-20% of the most useful documents are examined first.. Only about one of three searches should have to go on to a search over the remainder of the file.."
"The much-vaunted information explosion seems to be the manifestation of a rather generalized publication inflation.. Multipublication and pretentious writing have become obstacles to ""communication between human minds"". To counteract their harmful effects it will be necessary to reduce the quantity and improve the quality of the printed records by filtering the material before it is stored for retrieval.."
"Rather than reiterate the obvious purposes and procedures involved in creating a computer system for control of serials, in this paper the author deals with the concept upon which the UCLA system is based and the manner in which the system is maintained in day-to-day operations of the UCLA Biomedical Library.. The paper deals with some of the points made in an earlier publication from the UCLA serials project.. The attempt is to show how the theory of publication pattern (discussed in the earlier article) has been used to produce a different idea in computer control of serials.. Publication pattern information which is entered into the master record for each title causes check-in cards for the next expected issue of each title to be generated by the computer, regardless of when this text issue is expected - next week, next month, next year.. This is departure from most systems, which attempt to predict a certain number of issues which should arrive during a given time period.. The information, which must be a part of the computer record, is described, as are library procedures in maintaining the system.."
"The paper is a report of most of the major findings of a study in searching the periodical eye research literature.. Questions were collected from eye researchers and a selected group of these were searched in nine different secondary sources.. Articles thought to be relevant were Xeroxed and sent to the eye researchers who subsequently rated the articles.. Articles of eye research interest are found in a wide variety of journals, but a small number of journals carry a large proportion of the articles judged valuable by the eye researchers.. Approximately a fourth of eye research articles are in foreign languages.. Translations are not readily available.. Despite a delay of more than 15 month between the original appearance of article in journals and the mailing of photocopies, about half of the articles of interest to the researchers were not known to them previously.. For extensive retrospective searches more than one secondary service must be used.. Index Medicus and Excerpta Medica (Section 12) or Ophthalmic Literature would be good sources.. MEDLARS demand searches were not shown to be clearly superior to manual searches of Index Medicus.. Titles, abstracts, and full text were shown to be equally effective in permitting searches to retrieve references that were subsequently rated as relevant by the researchers.. A searcher with a background in ophthalmology was able to retrieve more articles of research interest than other non-ophthalmologist searchers.."
"An aspect of the human use of information that has generally been overlooked in the automation in information services is the human tendency to locate information spatially.. Computer-based systems do not necessarily assign any unique role to spatial tags, and so a feature of considerable importance for the organization of the user's memory seems to have been largely overlooked.. The spatial dimension of human memory is discussed, and some suggestions are offered for exploiting it more effectively in the context of information retrieval services.."
Previous applications of simulation to information storage and retrieval systems (ISRS) have been overly restrictive in their scope and have failed to consider the environment within which such systems operate.. This paper considers the ISRS as a subsystem within a larger system which includes the users and the funders of the retrieval system.. The three components form a closed-loop information feedback system in which user response influences both the funding and operation of the ISRS as it attempts to satisfy user needs within a finite budget allocation.. Reward-cost theory provides the basis for describing user behavior.. An industrial dynamics model has been developed to simulate ISRS/user/funder behavior where a university departmental library is the ISRS component.. The results which such an analysis can produce are discussed..
"(I) Better understanding of subject document retrieval might result if different functions of subject document retrieval system are studied separately.. This paper is concerned with retrieval of documents, in response to a question, from which answers to that question can be inferred (""answer-providing documents"").. ""Answer can be inferred from document"" has many possible meanings, one of which must be selected (an ""inference specification"").. Inasmuch as scientists in a field disagree about the correctness of inferences, have somewhat different background knowledge, etc., any inference specification can only approximate scientific inference practices.. Two sources of systematic knowledge of document-statement inference practices in a scientific field are described.. (II) If a content word occurs in a question, then it occurs in any answer to that question (with some apparently tractable exceptions).. An indexing procedure based on that fact is described which would permit retrieval of all answer-providing documents for a question.. However, because the indexing is ""nonrelational"", it could cause false retrievals as well.. Various ways of dealing with such false retrievals are   briefly indicated, and a study is sketched that would provide data for helping selection among them.. Two special point concerning indexing for retrieval of answer-providing documents are discussed separately.."
The results of an experiment in the use of statistical techniques for extracting a technical vocabulary from document texts are presented and discussed..
"An empirical investigation of the role of documents in relevance judgements is reported.. Abstracts previously judged relevant, partially relevant, and nonrelevant to each of 61 questions were compared to see whether textual differences could be found which might reasonably account for the rating differences.. The results of this comparison were fairly clear-cut characterizations in each case of relevant and partially relevant abstracts.. These characterizations were found to be expressible largely as meaningful co-occurrences of terms closely related to the question.. It is suggested that the textual bases of user choices may be more understandable than has been supposed.."
"The SMART automatic document retrieval system is used to study association procedures for automatic content analysis.. The effect of word frequency and other parameters on the association process is investigated through examination of related pairs and through retrieval experiments.. Associated pairs of words usually reflect localized word meanings, and true synonyms cannot readily be found from first or second order relationships in our document collections.. There is little overlap between word relationships found through associations and those used in thesaurus construction, and the effects of word associations and a thesaurus in retrieval are independent.. The use of associations in retrieval experiments improves not only recall, by permitting new matches between requests and documents, but also precision, by reinforcing existing matches.. In our experiments, the precision effect is responsible for most of the improvement possible with associations.. A properly constructed thesaurus, however, offers better performance than statistical association methods.."
"The effectiveness of conventional document indexing is compared with that achievable by fully automatic text processing methods.. Evaluation results are given for a comparison between the MEDLARS search system used at the National Library of Medicine and the experimental SMART system, and conclusions are reached concerning the design of future automatic information systems.."
Results of some 50 different retrieval methods applied in three experimental retrieval systems were subjected to the analysis suggested by statistical decision theory.. The analysis validates a previously-proposed measure of effectiveness and demonstrates its several desirable properties.. The examination of a wide range of data in relation to this one metric provides a clear and general assessment of the current state of the retrieval art..
The purpose of this paper is to describe a research project conducted at a technical center to test the hypothesis that: A theoretically-sound managerial cost-accounting system can be designed to meet the specific characteristics of a technical information center by revising and innovating systems utilized by other enterprises.. A computerized cost system was developed and operated for a three-month period to test this hypothesis.. The results of the study indicate that effective managerial cost accounting is possible for a technical information center.. Relevant cost information was generated periodically to measure the operating performance of the center's production process.. A summary of the data that were reported regularly to management is presented in this paper..
"A comprehensive program to evaluate the performance of MEDLARS was conducted by the National Library of Medicine in 1966 and 1967.. This report describes the methodology used and presents a summary of the principal results, conclusions, and recommendations.."
"The author's journal reference cards for 1965 and 1966 were analyzed according to three ""interest patterns"": (I) the total collection of 1469 article titles, a ""potentially useful"" set; (II) a subset concerning only his research speciality; and (III) a subset of articles defined as ""useful"". For each pattern, journals were ranked by frequency of use and a scatter diagram was drawn.. Patterns I and II largely resembled patterns obtained by counting citations in basic journals or by counting publications of selected researchers.. Pattern III was more widely scattered..  It is concluded that access to diverse journals is needed by researchers to supply new ideas, and that this diversity of reading is not reflected adequately by citation counting or other indirect means.. Current Contents, used by the author for current-awareness purposes in building his card file, generated 88% of all articles.. Scatter diagrams indicated the decreased scatter predicted from its use.. The 30% most important journals in this collection, including about 80% of titles, are ranked for each pattern.."
Work concerned with the statistical evaluation of the output of the MEDICO automatic indexing method is described.. The statistical test were designed primarily to examine the validity of the assumptions which formed the basis of the algorithms developed for the automatic computation of weights and for the automatic generation of links between index terms and modifiers.. This evaluation also includes a comparison of the output generated from full text and from the processing of the abstracts or summaries of the same articles..
"When adding a document to a collection, an indexer should choose a representation which makes evident both the content of the document and its relation to other documents already in the collection.. Toward this end, the Negotiated Search Facility (NSF) makes possible indexer-controlled retrieval of information from a collection data base using tools beyond those available in a traditional bibliographic catalog.. The design philosophy of NSF is to offer a framework to guide the indexer while allowing him freedom to retrieve any data which he judges will help him make indexing decisions.. An example which indicates how an indexer might use the facility also shows how the display formats and command language promote interaction.. While the discussion is directed toward indexing, it should be clear that the facility would be equally useful to the searcher.."
"A statistically based method for automatically identifying keywords in machine-readable text has been developed which produces keyword lists that agree better with composite lists produced by panels of human indexers than do lists produced by five statistical criteria previously suggested, and also better than lists produced by most of the individual panel members.. The method makes use of both the in-document word-occurrence frequency and the in-corpus relative occurrence frequency as measures of word importance.. Each statistical criterion was compared with the performance of human indexers by the use of rank correlation statistics.. The simple word count was found to be superior to the other four previously suggested criteria - all of which made use of the in-corpus relative occurrence frequency.. The test were conducted over 19 documents dealing with the subject of Information Science, a total of over 66,000 word occurrences.. Seventeen indexers representing eight different information centers participated in experiments.."
"To improve accessibility and maintenance of art slides in the United States Military Academy Library at West Point, a model card with a graphic image of the slide was designed with pertinent identifying information displayed directly above a black-and-white opaque photo and also key-punched into it.. The card serves for ample comparison reference previous to handling the slides and can produce a subject-arranged permuted index in book form.. The later permits access from the approach of form, geographic area, name, time of origin, artist, school, or style, etc.. Some added advantages, common to other kinds of graphic collections, are detailed.. Estimated costs of photo-reproduction of original cards, various kinds of copies, and computer time and materials are listed.. Future benefits from a consistent, unified cataloging system for graphic objects and the dissemination of this kind of information in a network structure are indicated as major goals.."
"A measure of indexing consistency is developed based on the concept of ""fuzzy-sets"".. It assigns a higher consistency value if indexers agree on the more important terms.. Measures of the quality of an indexer's work and exhaustivity of indexing are also proposed.. Experimental data on indexing consistency is presented for certain categories of indexers; and consistency, quality, and exhaustivity values are compared and analyzed.. The analysis of indexing exhaustivity leads to the conclusion that the increase of information as a result of group indexing is a process analogous to Bradford's law of information scattering, Lotka's law of scientific productivity, and Zipf's law of vocabulary distribution.."
"It is often assumed that the amount of interindexer consistency experienced under a given method of indexing is somehow indicative of the quality of the indexing.. To explore this assumption, two hypotheses are stated concerning the possible connection between interindexer consistency and indexing quality.. A specific counter-example is then exhibited which shows both hypotheses to be invalid.. Although a mathematical analysis of the counterexample yields certain insights, the general relationship between interindexer consistency and successful retrieval is more subtle than might have been expected.. It is concluded that until equations describing this relationship have been derived, measurements of inter-indexer consistency will have little meaning as clues to indexing quality.."
"A state-of-the art literature review on the cost of classification, cataloging, indexing, and abstracting has been included.. It was found that while some data on specific costs are available, the literature is generally found lacking from the point of view of accuracy, completeness, consistency, and availability.."
"Eighty-two documents and 30 questions, in documentation and related areas, was compared to find answer-providing documents (documents from which answers to questions can be inferred).. Two judges (documentation experts) made comparisons independently.. They discussed their disagreements, attempting to resolve them.. In each case the positive judge was first asked to indicate what answer he inferred, and from what document passage(s).. The further discussion depended on the details of each case.. In general, the resolution procedures used will resolve a disagreement about whether a document is answer-providing or reduce it to a familiar kind of scientific disagreement (about a passage's meaning, a statement's correctness, or an inference's correctness).. This seems better than treating relevance judgements as subjective and not open to rational discussion.."
"It is pointed out that if information science is to be considered a ""true"" science similar to physics or chemistry then it must have a set of concepts and analytical expression which apply to the flow of information in a general way.. In several previous papers, the author and a colleague have described a model of a generalized information system which has  wide, and perhaps universal applicability.. This paper elaborates on this model and indicates the range of its applicability.. Several fundamental quantities are defined specifically in a way which allows for quantification.. It is pointed out in this paper that this model can be the basis for the development of a ""true"" science of information with all of the necessary requirements for a science.. By the use of this model and the definition of a ""true"" science, the goals and requirements for a curriculum in information science are thus established.. Within this context, information is defined as data of value in decision making.. Quantitative measures of information can be obtained by relating information to specific observable actions which can be measured physically.."
"Two indexes to a collection of 3,204 documents in the field of chemistry were  test-searched.. The indexes are a keyword from title index without added keywords and a single access point per document alphabetic subject index.. The indexes were searched by 13 graduate chemistry students using 55 questions.. Search results are characterized in terms of recall, precision, and search time.. There is no statistically significant difference in recall and precision search result between the multiple access points per document keyword from title index and the single access point per document alphabetic subject index.. Search time was significantly better for the alphabetic subject index for all but those questions having only one relevant document.."
"The following books and journals for the Core Nursing Library, suggested reference materials, and supplementary books and journals were selected by experts in nursing from all parts of the United States. The purpose is to let practitioners and community hospitals know which books and journals, from a wealth of printed material would, in the opinion of experts, be most useful, especially where funds and space are limited."
"With increasing scientific collaboration, visibility of individual role-performance has diminished.. Ordering of author' names as an adaptive device which symbolizes their relative contributions to research.. Interviews with Nobel laureates and comparisons of their name-order practices to those of other scientists suggest that this symbol is ambiguous and makes evaluation of individual role-performance difficult.. A probability model of expected distribution of name orders is used in measuring preferences for particular sequences, and these preferences vary with the authors' eminence.. On the assumptions that authors' names are listed in order of the value of their contributions, laureates should be first-authors more often than other scientists; in fact, they are not.. Instead, they exercise their noblesse oblige by giving credit to less eminent co-workers increasingly as their eminence grows.. They do so more often after the prize, and eminent laureates-to-be forego first-authorship more often than  those as yet unrecognized.. The noblesse oblige, however, has its limits; laureates' contributions to prize-winning research are more visible than contributions to their other research.."
"The Matthew Effect occurs when scientists receive differential recognition for a particular scientific contribution depending on their location in the stratification system.  Merton originally introduced the concept to explain the allocation of credit among authors of multiple discoveries or collaborators.  In this paper the concept is generalized to apply to all scientific work.  If the Matthew Effect were to operate, the reception of papers of equal quality should be influenced by the location of their authors in the stratification system. To test this hypothesis, data are drawn from several studies of similar design.  In each study we control for the number of citations papers received at time 2.  This enables us to look at groups of papers that were judged to be roughly equal in quality at time 2. We then see whether there were any differences in the reception of these papers at time 1 depending upon various aspects of the author's location in the stratification system.  All the data indicate that assessed quality of papers at time 2 is a more important determinant of a paper's initial reception than any of the stratification variables.  However, the speed of diffusion of papers of equal quality is influenced by the reputation of the author based on past work that is being heavily utilized at the time of a new discovery.  The Matthew Effect also operates for those scientists located at prestigious points of the social system of science.  All other stratification variables, including eminence as measured by receipt of awards did not influence the speed of diffusion.  Data are presented that indicate that top papers written by high-ranking scientists are no more likely to be widely diffused early than are top papers by low- ranking scientists.  The Matthew Effect also serves to focus attention on the work of little-known men who collaborate with scientists of high repute and to increase retroactively the visibility of the early work of scientists who go on to greater fame.  A discussion is included of the relevance of these data for the study of resistance to scientific discoveries."
"In most libraries most users face a complex, monolithic arrangement of entries in catalogs and books on shelves.  In classical librarianship no effort can be made to personalize the listing of titles or arrangement of volumes for an individual user.  A user is unidentified, and, except for that small fraction of a percent who consult reference librarians, users remain nameless. The computer, however, with its superb ability to treat users as individual persons and events as individual events, possesses the potential for enabling big libraries to recapture the human qualities of which classical librarianship has deprived them since their days as one-librarian libraries.  However, rehumanization is not the only contribution computerization will make to libraries. Developments in modern society are forcing libraries to establish new objectives.  Contemporary living is information based, a phenomenon that is outmoding the venerable concept of library function.  As small special libraries already do, all libraries must participate in the cultural activities of the individuals in their communities rather than merely make available a torpid ""service."" Libraries must look forward to supplying information to a user when and where he needs it - an objective impossible to attain with classical library techniques."
This article contains a call for active participation by all segments of the library and educational community in the Williams and Wilkins controversy and in the effort to achieve appropriate copyright revision.
"Sometimes it seems as if the library world has divided into two camps; those who seem to know all about this thing called ""OCLC"" and who keep popping that rounded acronym into their conversation with a certain bromidic effervescence, and the other camp - plain folk who are happy to take library life one acronym at a time, as they need it, and who, if pressed, might guess that OCLC has something to do with, oh, Optical Codes at the Library of Congress? Only in Ohio - where the Ohio College Library Center began and where this national, computerized, bibliographic data exchange continues to grow - is OCLC universally a library household term, even among computer-phobes.  In Ohio, most librarians already realize the kind of thing going on at OCLC is not simply the building up of someone else's data base in little bits and bytes, but perhaps the biggest revolution in access to library collections since books were unchained from the shelves."
"This book is the result of a collaborative effort extending over seven years.  We have tried hard to make the book a genuine joint product to which each of us made the contributions he is best qualified to make.  There is no senior author; the sequence of name is simply alphabetical, and we have reversed it in signing the preface and elsewhere to emphasize this fact.  Our collaboration was motivated by our shared interest in social stratification, our common concern with advancing scientific social theory on the basis of systematic research, and the conviction that the inquiry would benefit from the different qualifications and viewpoints the two of us represent.  There can be no doubt that our interests in and approaches to sociological problems differ to a considerable degree.  Although we agree that refining research methods and advancing social theory are both important, for example, it is only fair to state that Duncan lays more stress on deriving theoretical generalizations."
"The United States has been engaged in activities known variously as technical assistance, technical cooperation, or development assistance for the past twenty-five years.  This form of foreign aid, either government sponsored or privately supported, is a twentieth century phenomenon.  The broader concept, foreign aid or foreign assistance, means providing another country with any kind of goods, whether financial, commodity, or manpower, to almost any purpose, and extends to antiquity.  Technical assistance, which may be defined, on the other hand, as the supplying of techniques, is an outgrowth of the industrial revolution and parallels America's rise in the nineteenth century to world recognition as an important industrial and trade power.  Government use of such aid as an instrument of foreign policy, as well as the integration of these private and public efforts in the foreign assistance field, began to develop under President Roosevelt's Good Neighbor Policy.  This integration soon expanded under the new cultural relations program which the United States implemented during World War II to offset the Nazi propaganda and cultural offensive in Latin America."
"The recent upsurge of interest in the behavioral aspects of scientific and technical communication and information flow has two distinct sources, a theoretical one in the development of communication research, and a practical one in the concerns of policy makers in scientific organizations and information services. For some time past, the attention of sociologists and social psychologists studying communication processes, once focused on so-called mass phenomena and mass publics, has turned to the interplay of communication processes with more and more definitely delineated and mapped aspects of social structure. One aspect of this shift in interest has been the increasing attention paid by behavioral scientists to the systems supplying information of a specialized sort, and to the publics which are consumers of this specialized information. The scientific and applied professions have been most prominent among the publics so studied."
"The preceding papers have addressed themselves to the study of information flow in a particular stream of human activity which has been variously called science, pure science, basic research, or fundamental research, and which is only secondarily, if at all, concerned with the practical utilization of its products. At this point it is appropriate to note that there is a parallel activity which includes applied research, exploratory development, and engineering development. This second stream of research we will call technology. Far more is known about the flow of information among scientists than among technologists.  From the knowledge that is available, however, we are led to conclude that the communication patterns in the two areas of activity are not only largely independent of one another, but qualitatively different in their nature.  This difference is reflected most clearly in the mechanisms by which information is diffused within the two sets of practitioners.  The present paper is addressed to these differences and to a discussion of the nature of the communication process between science and technology."
"The aforementioned studies are related to the problem of information exchange in psychology. Journals are a part of the formal channel of scientific communication as well as storage elements for the summary accounts of research undertakings. Analysis of bibliographical citations thus can reveal certain characteristics of the pattern of information flow created by scientists in their work.  The potential usefulness of this type of investigation is increased when it becomes possible to examine the trends through time of the communication network under consideration, and also when different communication networks can be compared. The present paper deals with some of the characteristics of bibliographical citations in the same 21 psychological journals published both in 1950 and in 1960. The list of journals used, along with the abbreviations to be used here, is given in Table 1; it includes 8 journals published by the American Psychological Association and 13 journals published by other organizations."
"There is considerable apprehension today within the scientific community over the communication crisis in science.  The present article, which attempts to clarify certain aspects of the problem, overviews the data collected by the APA Project on Scientific Information Exchange in Psychology, together with data which we have more recently obtained relative to other disciplines. Such a reexamination of the data should help to clarify APA's relationship to the many information media involved in the communication process which begins with research and ends with the incorporation of research findings into psychological knowledge."
"An individual correlation is a correlation in which the statistical object or thing described is indivisible.  The correlation between color and illiteracy for persons in the United States, shown later in Table 1, is an individual correlation, because the kind of thing described is an indivisible unit, a person.  In an individual correlation the variables are descriptive properties of individuals, such as height, income, eye color, or race, and not descriptive statistical constants such as rates or means. In an ecological correlation the statistical object is a group of persons.  The correlation between the percentage of the population which is Negro and the percentage of the population which is illiterate for the 48 states, shown later as Figure 2, is an ecological correlation.  The thing described is the population of a state, and not a single individual.  The variables are percentages, descriptive properties of groups, and not descriptive properties of individuals."
"We can only guess what historians of the future will say about the condition of present-day sociology.  But it seems safe to anticipate one of their observations. When the Trevelyans of 2050 come to write that history - as they well might, for this clan of historians promises to go on forever - they will doubtless find it strange that so few sociologists (and historians) of the twentieth century could bring themselves, in their work, to treat science as one of the great social institutions of the time.  They will observe that long after the sociology of science became an identifiable field of inquiry, it remained little cultivated in a world where science loomed large enough to present mankind with the choice of destruction or survival.  They may even suggest that somewhere in the process by which social scientists take note of the world as it is and as it once was, a sense of values appears to have become badly scrambled."
correlation between maternal and fetal plasma levels of glucose and free fatty acids . correlation coefficients have been determined between the levels of glucose and ffa in maternal and fetal plasma collected at delivery . significant correlations were obtained between the maternal and fetal glucose levels and the maternal and fetal ffa levels . from the size of the correlation coefficients and the slopes of regression lines it appears that the fetal plasma glucose level at delivery is very strongly dependent upon the maternal level whereas the fetal ffa level at delivery is only slightly dependent upon the maternal level .
"changes of the nucleic acid and phospholipid levels of the livers in the course of fetal and postnatal development . we have followed the evolution of dna, rna and pl in the livers of rat foeti removed between the fifteenth and the twenty-first day of gestation and of young rats newly-born or at weaning . we can observe the following facts.. 1. dna concentration is 1100 ug p on the 15th day, it decreases from the 19th day until it reaches a value of 280 ug 5 days after weaning . 2. rna concentration is 1400 ug p on the 15th day and decreases to 820 during the same period . 3. pl concentration is low on the 15th day and during foetal life (700 ug) and increases abruptly at birth . 4. the ratios rna cyto/dna and pl cyto/dna increase regularly from the 18th day of foetal life . 5. nuclear rna and pl contents are very high throughout the development . 6. these results enable us to characterize three stages in the development of the rat liver.. - from the 15th day to the 18th day of foetal life.. stage of growth through hyperplasia without hypertrophy, - from the 19th day of foetal life to the 3rd day of post-natal life,. stage of cellular reorganisation, - after the 3rd day of post-natal life.. stage of growth through hyperplasia and hypertrophy ."
"surfactant in fetal lamb tracheal fluid . lambs delivered by cesarean section with intact fetal circulation have a fluid filling the trachea . analysis revealed that this fluid contained material high in surface activity in lambs delivered near term, but less surface activity in premature lambs . administration of 10 per cent oxygen to the ewe for 1 hour prior to delivery did not alter the surfactant properties of the fetal tracheal fluid . two analyses of the fetal tracheal fluid revealed it to contain 146 and 198 mg. of lipid per 100 ml., 30 to 40 per cent of which was phospholipid, part of the active component of surfactant . the investigations reported here offer a model for further research into possible intrauterine factors in the pathogenesis of hyaline membrane disease ."
"placental and cord blood lipids.. comparison in a set of double ovum twins, a stillborn and a live-born . 1. determinations of phospholipid, total and free cholesterol, triglyceride and nefa have been made on placental tissue and cord blood in a set of double ovum twins, one stillborn and one live-born . 2. similarities occurred in all fractions studied except the cord blood triglyceride and nefa levels . 3. the serum of the stillborn infant contained one-third as much triglyceride and 21/2 times as much nefa as did the live-born infant . 4. the phospholipid content and the total lipid content of the stillbirth placenta were the highest studied in this laboratory which includes determinations on 26 live births . 5. the suggestion is made that increased lipoprotein lipase activity in the cord blood may accompany intrauterine fetal death ."
"free fatty acid concentration in maternal plasma and fetal body fat content . subcutaneous injection of 200 u.s.p. units of heparin into female sprague-dawley rats produced large and sustained elevations of plasma free fatty acids but no significant change in blood glucose . a group of pregnant rats received such injections of heparin 3 times daily throughout pregnancy . the fetuses from mothers of this group, at 191/2 and 211/2 days of gestation, had significantly more body fat than the fetuses from uninjected mothers . the hypothesis is presented that the maternal free fatty acid concentration in part determines fetal fat accumulation . it is proposed that the body composition changes noted in babies of mothers with diabetes might thus be ascribed to abnormally high maternal plasma free fatty acid concentrations ."
"the concentration of non-esterified fatty acids in maternal and fetal plasma in intact, alloxan-diabetic and x-ray-irradiated rats . determinations of the non-esterified fatty acids in the plasma of pregnant rats showed that there do not exist any increases in the concentrations depending on pregnancy during the period from the 20th - 22nd day of pregnancy . in the fetal plasma the concentrations of non-esterified fatty acids only amounted to 40 - 50 per cent of the maternal values . with alloxan diabetes produced 2 days prior to the test the concentration in the maternal plasma increased three- to fivefold, while at the same time a significant rise was absent in fetal plasma with slightly increased average values . whole-body x-ray exposures (dose.. 400r, dose output.. 40r/min) of non-pregnant female and of pregnant rats beginning on the 17th day of pregnancy did not result in any changes of the concentration of non-esterified fatty acids immediately after irradiation ."
"lipid metabolism in toxemia and normal pregnancy . the amount and fatty acid composition of total lipid extract from serum were examined in normal pregnant women in the first, second, and third trimesters, and early postpartum period, and in patients with mild and severe preeclampsia and with essential hypertension . placentas at term were also examined for total lipid and its fatty acid composition . in the normal women, total serum lipid increased during pregnancy . the rise was less pronounced in those with preeclampsia or hypertension . serum palmitate was mildly but significantly elevated in preeclampsia . total lipid and arachidonic acid were elevated in the placentas of preeclamptic women . the findings are compared with those obtained from animals developing eclampsia on an experimental basis ."
"essential fatty acids and acids with trans-configuration in the subcutaneous and visceral fat of the newborn . we made an investigation of the subcutaneous and visceral fat in the newborn . we estimated the contents of linolic and linolenic acid and of acids with trans-configuration spectrophotometrically . we were able to show the penetration of these acids through the placental barrier . the essential fatty acid contents of fat in the newborn is low . in immature ones about 7-14 g, there is a rising trend."
"acetoacetate formation by livers from human fetuses aged 8-17 weeks . slices and homogenates from livers of human fetuses aged 8-17 weeks have a low rate of acetoacetate formation which can be raised by addition of acetate or octanoate to the incubation medium . it was not possible to demonstrate acetoacetate formation by isolated liver mitochondria from 17-week-old fetuses, probably because mitochondria are injured during isolation ."
"changes in blood glucose and non-esterified fatty acids in the foetal and newborn lamb after injection of adrenaline . changes in blood glucose and non-esterified fatty acids after intravenous adrenaline were measured in foetal, newborn and adult sheep in the foetus and immediately after birth there was very little increase in either blood glucose or non-esterified fatty acids after adrenaline . the response of blood glucose to adrenaline had reached adult levels at twenty-four hours of age . the response of non-esterifi- ed fatty acids to adrenaline increased gradually over the first week ."
"electron-microscopic observatations on transference of fat through the human placenta . from the results of our previous and present studied on the transportation of fat through the human placenta by means of electron microscopy, we obtained the following conclusions . 1) neutral fat can permeate through the human placenta without dissociation . 2) almost all processes of fat permeation seem to be due to the biological activity . pinocytosis is most representative, but the authors newly found several facts such as dissolution-like change in the basement membrane and transport via the stroma cell . the authors believe that these results will bring a clue to explain the mechanism of biological transportation of materials through the placenta ."
"the content of phosphatides, triglycerides and cholesterol in placentas, maternal, fetal and new-born liver of the white rat . thin-layer-chromatographic examinations in the maternal rat liver showed different rise of the triglycerides and a significant increase of the esterified cholesterol, however, no striking changes in the content of free cholesterol and lipid phosphorus with the fractions examined (lecithin, colamine cephalin, sphingomyelin and lysolecithin) . as compared to the liver of adult rats, the fetal liver contains a little less than 50 per cent lipid phosphorus . the difference is conditioned by the concentrations of lecithin, and colamine cephalin . on the 19th day the content of triglycerides is lower than in the mother rat . referred to the dry weight, there results a decrease of all phosphatide fractions, as well as of the free cholesterol and a slight rise of the triglycerides from the 19th to the 22nd day . the rise of the phosphatide concentrations to the values of adult rats occurs immediately after birth under the influence of milk food, which, moreover, leads to a considerable increase of the triglyceride values . phospholipid- and triglyceride concentrations of the placenta correspond to those of the fetal liver . solely the content of free cholesterol is higher at the end of pregnancy . the content of triglyceride drops towards the 22nd day ."
"analysis of mammalian lens proteins by electrophoresis . lens proteins of different mammalian species were analyzed by two-dimensional starch gel electrophoresis . the number of fractions detected by this means varied from 11-20 . a-crystallin was resolved into two to three components, b-crystallin into 5-11, and y-crystallin into three to five components . this technique provides a sensitive method for the fractionation of lens proteins and for analyzing species differences ."
"an autoradiographic study on cell migration in the eye lens epithelium from normal and alloxan diabetic rats . lenses from normal and alloxan diabetic rats with and without cataract were investigated by autoradiography 4 hours, 4 days and 8 days after an intraperitoneal injection of h3-thymidine (0.4 uc/g body weight) . the rats were made diabetic 8 days prior to the injection of thymidine at an age of 4 weeks . the position of labelled nuclei of the lens epithelium was noted and their grain numbers counted . the diabetic rats had a lower frequency of labelled nuclei than the controls but after 4 hours their grain counts were equal . frequency diagrams of labelled nuclei are given for each of the three experimental periods . a predominant peak appears after 4 hours at a distance of 30-60 cells in front of the beginning of the nuclear arc . a successive shift towards this area was observed for the longer experimental periods . the shift of the peaks was more restricted in the diabetic animals . this result may best be interpreted as an effect of an increased time of cell generation . as an appendix a histotechnique for the eye lens is given in collaboration with mrs. gertraude moewis ."
"lens development.. the differentiation of embryonic chick lens epithelial cells in vitro and in vivo . the behavior of lens epithelial cells from six-day chick embryos was studied in three different experimental situations.. (a) explantation into several different fluid culture media, (b) explantation followed by reimplantation into lensectomized embryonic eyes, and (c) explantation followed by reimplantation into the embryonic coelomic cavity . specimens were examined histologically, and the total volume of the lens material of each specimen was determined from the planimetry of serial sections . the results were interpreted as follows.. 1. with a small amount of protein supplement in the culture medium, embryonic lens epithelial cells are capable of a limited amount of independent cytodifferentiation . without protein supplement they fail to undergo any fiber formation . 2. when returned to the eye environment, cultured epithelial explants will respond with a resumption of growth, with further cellular differentiation, and with at least some of the morphogenetic changes necessary to form a lens . the embryonic coelom will not support these responses . 3. the initiation of the formation of lens fibers is not sufficient for their complete autonomous maturation . 4. the internal architecture of the developing lens is not the only determinant of its overall shape ."
"treatment of active chronic hepatitis and lupoid hepatitis with 6-mercaptopurine and azothioprine . 6-mercaptopurine or azothioprine ('imuran') was used successfully in 3 patients with active chronic hepatitis and 2 with lupoid hepatitis, for periods up to 1 year . these drugs allowed modification and even abolition of discomforting corticosteroid regimes . their action in chronic hepatitis may be analogous to their anti-immune action in suppressing homograft rejection ."
"treatment of collagen diseases with cytostatics . 22 patients with collagen diseases and 3 patients with other immunological diseases were treated with the cytostatic antimetabolites ('purinethol') 6-mercaptopurine and ('imuran') azathioprine for an average period of four months (range one to eleven months) . improvement was obtained in 17 patients,. and, in 20 out of 22 patients who had been on long-term glucocorticoid medication, the steroid therapy could be permanently discontinued . serious complications occurred, in the form of two deaths from pancytopenia and sepsis . the treatment requires careful supervision of the patients, and should only be instituted, on strict indications, when the alternative is long-term glucocorticoid medication ."
bilateral popliteal cysts in a patient with rheumatoid arthritis . a case of bilateral popliteal cysts and multiple joint subluxations in a patient with rheumatoid arthritis on corticosteroid medication for many years is reported . the effect of long-term corticosteroid therapy on all periarticular connective tissue structure and the relationship of articular disease and popliteal knee cysts to this therapy have been discussed .
"systemic lupus erythematosus and renal transplantation.. report of two cases . two cases of systemic lupus erythematosus along with terminal uremia secondary to lupus nephritis are presented . both patients were treated with renal hemodialysis and transplantation . certain mechanical, infectious, and immunologic problems were responsible for their death . there was no evidence of resurgence of lupus erythematosus in either patient, and the transplanted kidneys did not show evidence of lupus nephritis . renal transplantation should be considered as a last resort in treatment of patients with terminal lupus nephritis ."

"genetic transcription during morphogenesis . messenger rna's from bacillus subtilis undergoing sporulation, germination, or step-down transition have been characterized and compared . hybrid competition experiments indicate that these messengers are derived from distinct genetic loci . the results are consistent with the hypothesis that differential transcription of the genome occurs during morphogenesis . the data also complement previously observed changes in morphology and enzymatic activity in sporulating bacteria ."
"renal amyloidosis a clinicopathological study . the clinical and histopathological data from 40 cases of renal amyloidosis diagnosed by percutaneous renal biopsy are presented . twenty-two cases were labelled as 'secondary' amyloidosis, as definite aetiological factors responsible for renal amyloidosis could be discovered . the predisposing disease states leading to amyloid deposits in the kidney in the order of frequency were fibrocaseous pulmonary tuberculosis, bronchiectasis, lung abscess, and ileocaecal tuberculosis five cases were labelled as suspected 'primary' amyloidosis as a definite evidence of the predisposing disease could not be obtained although the skiagram of chest revealed minimal healed foci . no cause could be determined in thirteen cases, which were, therefore, labelled as 'primary' amyloidosis . albuminuria was a constant feature in all the cases and 32 cases presented as nephrotic syndrome . the rest of the cases presented with hypertension or renal failure in addition to albuminuria . the ancillary procedure, viz., congo-red test, gingival and liver biopsies proved to be of limited value in the diagnosis of renal amyloidosis . the importance of percutaneous renal biopsy as a diagnostic tool has been emphasised ."
"idiopathic autoimmune hemolytic anemia and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura associated with diffuse hypergammaglobulinemia, amyloidosis, hypoalbuminemia and plasmacytosis . a case is reported of a sixty-nine year old woman with severe, idiopathic, autoimmune hemolytic anemia which was initially controlled by splenectomy . a relapse associated with the development of severe, autoimmune, thrombocytopenic purpura failed to respond to large doses of prednisone, but was controlled to a variable degree with imuran . associated features included diffuse hypergammaglobulinemia, excessive gamma-u proteins in the urine, idiopathic hypoalbuminemia with a greatly reduced total exchangeable albumin pool, amyloidosis in the spleen and other organs, and diffuse plasmacytosis of the bone marrow, lymph nodes, and thoracic and peritoneal fat . these features and their interrelationships are discussed . there was no deficiency in the synthesis of specific neutralizing antibodies against viruses, indicating that a qualitative immune deficiency did not exist . the frequency of occurrence of thrombocytopenic purpura in such a case is discussed, as is the prognosis . the mechanism of action of antimetabolites in inducing a remission in autoimmune hemolytic anemia, as well as the etiology of the disease, is reviewed ."
"corticosteroid therapy of amyloid nephrotic syndrome . the results of treatment with prolonged adrenal corticosteroids in 26 adults with amyloid nephrotic syndrome are presented . eight subjects were observed in this series, and 18 additional cases were summarized from the literature . twenty-two of the patients were male and four were female . the diagnosis was established by renal biopsy in 19 instances and by autopsy in the others, with 18 patients considered to have primary amyloidosis and 8, secondary amyloidosis . the majority of the subjects died in renal failure with an average survival after onset of the disease of 17.6 months . the renal disease was indistinguishable from that seen in other forms of the nephrotic syndrome, with the possible exceptions of (a) a high incidence of purpuric skin lesions, (b) a low or negligible incidence of hypertension (at times actual hypotension was prominent), and (c) a rapid and inexorable progression of azotemia despite persistence of the clinical and biochemical characteristics of the nephrotic syndrome . amyloidosis was found by percutaneous renal biopsy in 12 per cent of 83 adults with the nephotic syndrome . corticosteroids did not appear to affect the progress of the disease and were neither beneficial nor detrimental . in view of the high incidence of deleterious side effects of prolonged corticosteroid therapy and the availability of potent diuretic agents which may be helpful in relieving edema in this disorder, it is felt that corticosteroids are contraindicated in the treatment of amyloid nephrotic syndrome ."
"renal amyloidosis.. a biopsy study . the relationship of the amount of amyloid deposition in the kidney to the clinical picture is reviewed in 14 cases of renal amyloidosis diagnosed by renal biopsy . the large percentage of patients who had the nephrotic syndrome (11 patients) probably reflects the criteria for renal biopsy at this institution . the etiology of the amyloid deposition did not seem to be clearly correlated with either the amount of amyloid deposition in the kidney or the severity of the clinical renal disease . all patients had deposits in the glomerulus, and the heavier the deposition the severer the renal disease . of 7 patients who had biopsy of the bone marrow, all had abnormal types or numbers of plasma cells . the age range in primary amyloidosis appeared to be about the same as that in amyloidosis secondary to myeloma . amyloidosis should be suspected in patients with proteinuria, the nephrotic syndrome, or renal failure ."

"amyloid.. starch gel electrophoretic analysis of some proteins extracted from amyloid . proteins extracted by strong urea from washed tissue of patients with amyloidosis secondary to several diseases or associated with familial mediterranean fever have common major electrophoretic components . in hearts of primary amyloidosis one component in common with the secondary amyloid may be present . however, primary amyloid is much more difficult to dissolve and does not regularly give the components observed when the secondary amyloid is extracted . the big question remains as to what constituent or constituents comprise the fibrils now known to be a part of amyloid ."
"selectivity of protein excretion in patients with the nephrotic syndrome. with a gel diffusion precipitin technique and commercially prepared antisera, urine/plasma ratios of specific proteins were determined . individual protein clearances, expressed as a percentage of transferrin clearance, were plotted as ordinates against respective molecular weights on a log-log graph . a straight line was evident graphically, its constants were estimated by the method of least squares, and the slope, expressed as , was determined . the slope of the line may be said to express the degree of glomerular selectivity to protein excretion . sixty-five determinations were performed in 48 patients . 45 satisfying the usual criteria of the nephrotic syndrome . 1) those patients with primary renal disease and the nephrotic syndrome who displayed high selectivity types of proteinuria ( greater than the average for the group + 1 sd) usually respond initially to steroid therapy, regardless of the acute or subacute glomerular changes observed on renal biopsy . 2) those patients with chronic renal disease and the nephrotic syndrome display an average and frequently a low selectivity type of proteinuria . 3) there appears to be no characteristic type of selectivity for a given pathologic group of patients with the nephrotic syndrome . 4) the degree of selective protein excretion is not related to the total daily amount of protein being excreted at any one time and remains fairly constant despite fluctuation in the amount of protein being excreted . 5) there is a slight correlation of borderline significance between the degree of selective protein excretion and the duration of the disease, and the initial para-aminohippuric acid clearance . 6) a statistically significant correlation exists between the initial blood urea nitrogen or inulin clearance and the selectivity type of protein excretion . those patients who were not azotemic and had initially near-normal inulin clearances had an average selectivity type or better . 7) it is suggested that if the adult patient is initially azotemic and has a grossly abnormal inulin clearance, response to therapy is unlikely, whereas if the blood urea nitrogen is normal and the inulin clearance is near normal, response to therapy cannot be predicted with any degree of accuracy . further studies of adult patients with the nephrotic syndrome are required to substantiate this premise ."
"some aspects of haemostasis after open-heart surgery . synopsis in two groups of patients undergoing extracorporeal circulation with hypothermia, changes were found in the coagulation mechanism which were probably due to the dosage of polybrene administered . the role of heparin and polybrene and the concept of activation of the coagulation mechanism in the production of bleeding after perfusion are discussed ."
a case of interventricular septal defect with dextrocardia and situs inversus treated by surgery . a case of interventricular septal defect associated with situs inversus and dextrocardia in twenty year old male patient was presented along with discussion on three types of dextrocardial complexes and with emphasis on the rarity of occurrence of the intracardiac anomalies in true /mirror-image/ dextrocardia with total situs inversus . a comment was also made on kartagener's syndrome which was excluded by appropriate radiographic procedures in this case . the closure of the interventricular septal defect with extracorporeal circulation was successfully performed under moderate hypothermia .
"excretion patterns of urinary metabolites of estradiol-4-c14 in postmenopausal women with benign and malignant disease of the breast . a study of the excretion patterns of the urinary metabolites of estradiol-4-c1j administered to a group of 43 postmenopausal women, 38 with advanced mammary carcinoma prior to endocrine therapy and 5 with benign mammary dysplasia, is reported . a chromatographic method was employed for the determination of estradiol, estrone, and estriol and other estrogen metabolites . the urinary excretion pattern is defined by (a) the extent of excretion of isotope in each of 3 successive 24-hr. collection periods, (b) the percentage of the urinary radiometabolites enzymatically hydrolyzed, (c) the relative concentration of the several metabolites in the hydrolyzed fraction . wide subject-to-subject variations were found . the metabolites other than estradiol, estrone, and estriol comprised a large portion of the total estrogens excreted . a significantly lower amount of estradiol was noted in the group of women with mammary carcinoma as compared to the amount found in the group of women with benign mammary dysplasia, suggesting that the former group metabolizes more rapidly the administered estradiol . although the excretion patterns of patients who failed to respond to estrogen treatment (nonresponders) differed the greatest from the patterns associated with benign disease, distinctive patterns of the urinary excretion of isotopic estrogens which allowed a statistically significant or clinically useful separation between responders and nonresponders to subsequent estrogen therapy were not discovered ."
the localizing significance of limited simultaneous visual form perception . a patient presenting with an isolated /spelling dyslexia/ and impairment in picture interpretation (simultanagnosia) was shown by tachistoscopic studies to have a pathological limitation of simultaneous form perception . at autopsy a localized lesion was found within the inferior part of the left occipital lobe . these findings are discussed in relation to the problem of the disorder of function underlying /agnosic alexia/ .

"the development of social attachments in infancy . this report is devoted to the formation and development of social attachments in infancy . it is suggested that the core of the attachment function is represented by the tendency of the young to seek the proximity of certain other members of the species and that the most suitable operational definition may be found in the behavior of the individual when deprived of such proximity . the study takes the form of a longitudinal follow-up, in which 60 infants were investigated at four-weekly intervals from the early weeks on up to the end of the first year and again at 18 months of age . with the use of an attachment scale, based on seven everyday separation situations, the following three main parameters were explored.. the age at onset of specific attachments, the intensity of such attachments, and the number of objects to whom attachments are formed . a measure of fear-of-strangers was also included . results indicate that the age at onset of specific attachments is generally to be found in the third quarter of the first year, but that this is preceded by a phase of indiscriminate attachment behavior,. that the intensity of specific attachment increases most in the first month following onset and that thereafter fluctuations occur in individual cases which make long-term prediction difficult,. and that multiplicity of objects can be found in some instances at the very beginning of the specific attachment phase, becoming the rule in most of the remaining cases very soon thereafter . correlations between the attachment variables, as well as with the fear-of-strangers measure, are presented, and an examination is also made of the conditions eliciting protest at proximity loss, of the manner in which protest is expressed, and of the conditions necessary to terminate protest . individual differences with regard to the three main parameters were explored in a subgroup of 36 infants . a number of variables were examined in relation to these individual differences, and suggestions made regarding the conditions which affect the manifestation of the attachment function . the data are discussed in relation to four themes which emerged from the findings.. the nature of the attachment function, its developmental origins, its developmental trends, and the influence of the social setting ."
"separation anxiety as a cause of early emotional problems in children . in summary, three cases of disturbed behavior in children have been discussed, with particular emphasis on disturbances in feeding, sleeping, and motility . some of the hypotheses have been presented of why such behavior should develop,. the significance of attachment behavior and separation anxiety in infants has been particularly stressed . difficulties in mothering care are threatening to the child's sense of security and lead to greater experience of separation anxiety, which may then be reflected in various disturbances or alterations in his behavior . this experience of separation anxiety is the result of early life experience, may reach pathologic proportions, and may account for many later problems in children and adults ."

"intradermal test using cobalt chloride . selected groups of patients with cobalt allergy and nickel allergy as well as normal controls were tested intradermally with cobalt chloride in the dilutions 10 to 10 . reactions of the wheal and flare type appear during the first hours and make the 24-hour reading misleading . the papular response to cobalt chloride 10, when read 48 to 96 hours after the injection, appears to be a reliable test for cobalt allergy . patients with combined nickel-cobalt allergy were excluded from the study, and the question of group reactions is not discussed . nickel allergics give a somewhat stronger reaction than controls to the slightly impure cobalt chloride . it would be preferable if the degree of purity of the cobalt chloride were ten times greater ."
"measurements of nickel in biological materials by atomic absorption spectrometry . an atomic absorption procedure has been developed which facilitates quantitative measurements of nickel in biological materials, including urine, ribonucleic acids (rna), and serum proteins . the sensitivity of detection of nickel by the atomic absorption spectrometer (0.10 p.p.m.) was insufficient to permit direct measurements of nickel in normal urine . therefore, it was necessary to employ a dimethylglyoxime extraction procedure to concentrate the nickel, prior to atomic absorption spectrometry . the coefficients of variation of measurements of nickel in urine and human b- globulins were 6.3 and 5.9 per cent, respectively . the recovery of nickel added to urine averaged 96 per cent, with a range from 94 to 97, and the recovery of nickel added to human b-globulin averaged 101 per cent, with a range from 96 to 104 . the mean concentration of nickel in 24-hr. collections of urine from 17 normal subjects was 1.8 ug. per 100 ml. (s.d. = 0.8), with a range from 0.4 to 3.1 . the mean urinary excretion of nickel was 19.8 ug. per 24 hr. (s.d. = 10.0), with a range from 7.2 to 37.6 . the mean concentration of nickel in 5 preparations of ribonucleic acids from ultracentrifugal supernatants of homogenates of rat lung was 48 ug. of ni per gm. of rna, with a range from 34 to 64 . the mean concentration of nickel in 5 preparations of rna from ultracentrifugal supernatants of homogenates of rat liver was 29 ug. of ni per gm. of rna, with a range from 21 to 39 . measurements of nickel were performed upon fractions of human serum proteins, prepared by continuous-flow electrophoresis, and by cold-ethanol precipitation . the highest concentrations of nickel were found in preparations of serum b-globulins ."

"toxicity of inorganic selenium salts to chick embryos . the effects of selenite and selenate treatment by air cell injection on mortality and growth of 14-day chick embryos during a 64-68 hour period were studied . the ld for selenite-se was about 0.5 ppm, based on weight of the egg contents, and that for selenate-se about 1.8-2.0 ppm . growth depression was evident from these treatments, but other gross effects were not prominent . the treatment of embryos with selenite and sulfate together caused a greater mortality than treatment with selenite alone ."
"lesions of the islets of langerhans during injections of sodium selenite administered intravenously . sodium selenite was administered intravenously in rabbits and in dogs repeated injections can lead to the development of a diabetic syndrome in the rabbit . the histological examination of the pancreas in the poisoned animals (dogs and rabbits) has shown the existence of lesions of the islets of langerhans, mostly of the b cells which lose their granules partly or completely . these changes seem analogous to the ones produced by alloxan,. these two poisons act at first by inactivating the sh groups, which leads to a deficiency to which the b cells are very sensitive ."
"toxicity of sulfur-35, selenium, and tellurium to avian embryos . continuous internal irradiation of chick embryos with sulfur-35 administered on the 4th or 8th day of incubation produced abnormalities similar to those observed in selenium toxicosis of avian embryos . the highest level of sulfur-35 (1600 uc) injected into eggs containing 4-day embryos produced morphological abnormalities more severe than those produced by the same level of radiosulfur administered to 8-day embryos, or by any level of stable selenium tolerated . selenium at levels greater than 30 ug killed all the embryos within 24 hours after injection . nearly 20 times more tellurium than selenium was required to kill all the embryos within 24 hours.. no abnormalities were observed in the tellurium-injected embryos ."
"the effect of selenium on the upper respiratory passages . results are reported of examination of workers exposed to selenium, with special reference to chronic changes in the respiratory passages . the findings are the same as reported in the literature . we emphasize the occurrence of teleangiectasias on the uvula and on the posterior palatinal arcs and on the epiglotis . we describe the occurrence of the first poisoning with selenium xyde in this country . the poisoning healed within a few days under symptomatic treatment . the patient had however to be transferred into another shop owing to frequent symptoms due to toxic effect of selenium . we report also on secondary findings in examination of chronic changes and we emphasize particularly the finding of profesional selenium external otitis ."
the influence of small selenite doses upon the toxic fatty degeneration of the liver . sodium selenite (10 ug/kg) manifests a lipotropic effect after toxication of the rat by tetrachlorocarbon . this effect is absent when the selenite dose is increased to 50 ug/kg . the level of the total lipides of the liver after ethionine toxication is not significantly influenced by 10 ug selenite/kg . it is increased by 50 ug selenite/kg.
"selenium-caused tumours . in 10 out of 23 heterozygous rats administered 10 mg na seo per 1 kg food (containing 12 protein) and surviving for 18 months, cancer of the liver (with metastases in the lungs) along with sarcoma and adenoma was recorded . in another series of the yet incompleted experiment the animals were fed higher quantities of protein and selenium . toward 14-19 months in three of them sarcoma was noted.. in two sarcoma of the lymphatic nodes, and in one- of the mediastinum . it is suggested that the changes caused by selenium compounds are to some extent due to their antagonistic relationship with methionine ."
"blood and bone marrow damage caused by drugs . drug side effects on blood and bone marrow are briefly reviewed . they embrace a wide variety of symptoms and pathogenetic mechanisms, and in recent years study of these effects has made important contributions to our knowledge of the immunology, biochemistry and metabolism of the blood cells ."
"hypothermia.. physiologic effects and clinical application . a survey of the background, physiologic effects, indications, technique and complications of hypothermia is presented . the application of this technique is straightforward and safe when used at the proper levels with the proper indications ."
"ehrlich ascites tumor cells agglutination.. the interference exerted by epsilonaminocaproic acid (eac) and its acetyl derivative (eaca) . the activity of epsilon-aminocaproic acid (eac) and of its acetyl derivative (eaca) was studied on antigen-antibody reactions, membrane antigens and immune globulins . in vitro eac and eaca do not affect immune globulins, but they do alter the membrane antigens of ehrlich ascites tumor cells and inhibit the agglutination reaction induced by a specific antiserum . inhibition is only partially due to the antigenic alteration observed, and it represents more prominently a direct interference at the level of the antigen-antibody reaction . the membrane antigen alternations induced by the drugs and by nitrogen mustard were compared, taking into account their toxicity.. eac and eaca were found to be much more active and more specific than nitrogen mustard ."
"study on the behavior of tumor tissue in diffusion chambers against penetrating host cells in tumor-resistant rats . tumour cells in diffusion chambers, which were implanted in tumour-resistant rats, were only destroyed by penetrating immunized host cells when membrane filters of large pore size were used, whereas with filters of small pore size the tumour cells survived and remained virulent ."
"current status of hypothermia . moderate hypothermia has been recommended for many and varied conditions . today its value is being questioned in the light of controlled groups of patients . at the moment its use is justified in certain cardiac and other operations where circulation may be interrupted for short periods.. in general surgical procedures where massive, sudden blood loss may be anticipated.. in neurosurgical operations where a /relaxed/ brain is required.. following acute hypoxia such as seen in cardiac arrest.. and perhaps in the therapy of acute septicemic shock . profound hypothermia in association with extracorporeal circulation rests on shakier premises, but can be of value in major cardiac operations where asystole is required and in certain neurosurgical procedures where complete interruption of circulation is indicated . there is a great hazard in the development of inadvertent or unrecognized hypothermia in the anesthetized patient . monitoring of body temperature is an important feature of the care of the patient in the operating theater and in the recovery room ."
"hyperglycemic coronary perfusion.. effect of hypothermia on myocardial function during cardiopulmonary bypass . in a series of 84 animal experiments hyperglycemic perfusion of the heart gave significant protection to the anoxic heart . this protection was evaluated by ventricular function and contractile force studies and was observed after aortic occlusion at 37, 28 and 10 degrees c . metabolic data revealed a considerable myocardial glucose uptake, higher coronary ph, higher po and lower pco in the glucose-perfused groups as compared to controls . a hypothesis for the protective effect may be an alteration in metabolic pathway and support of the myocardial enzyme systems associated with high glucose concentration and utilization ."
"specific carcinoembryonic antigens of the human digestive system . a wide variety of human adult and fetal tissues were studied by immunodiffusion techniques in agar gel to determine whether they contained the tumor-specific antigen(s) previously found in colonic cancers . in the adult tissues it was demonstrated that identical antigens were present in all tested specimens of malignant tumors of the entodermally derived epithelium of the gastro-intestinal tract and pancreas, but were absent from all other tested adult tissues . the common antigenic constituents, therefore, represent system-specific cancer antigens of the human digestive system . system-specific cancer antigens have not previously been demonstrated in humans . experiments with fetal tissues demonstrated that identical antigens were also present in fetal gut, liver, and pancreas between 2 and 6 months of gestation . these components were named /carcinoembryonic/ antigens of the human digestive system . on the basis of the present findings and the recent work regarding control of the expression of genetic potentialities in various genetic potentialities in various types of cells, it was concluded that the carcinoembryonic antigens represent cellular constituents which are repressed during the course of differentiation of the normal digestive system epithelium and reappear in the corresponding malignant cells by a process of derepressive-dedifferentiation ."
the course of influenza virus infection in mice.. organ tissues of infected mice tested by electron microscope . using the electron microscope the presence of inclusions could be shown in the lungs and liver of mice infected with the pr 8 strain . the inclusions contained particles of size and shape closely resembling the most frequently seen forms of influenza virus . the presence of inclusions in liver tissue might perhaps speak for the possibility of virus multiplication in this organ .
"comparative bone marrow study using two aspiration needles and two biopsy sites . bone marrow aspiration is now widely used in the diagnosis of hematologic diseases and many conditions not primarily affecting the blood system . a number of techniques have been devised by which a suitable specimen of marrow can be obtained with relatively little discomfort to the patient . the two needle sets described in this paper have been found to be equally reliable in obtaining bone marrow for microscopic study and diagnosis . comparative studies of bone marrow aspirated simultaneously from the iliac crest and the sternum in 26 patients show no significant difference . however, there were four instances of dry tap at the iliac site . this fact, in addition to the observation that less discomfort was experienced by the patient when the sternum was used, might indicate that the sternal area is a more reliable and efficient site for obtaining bone marrow . it was also observed during this study that patients experienced less discomfort when the university of illinois needle was used . the major objection to the use of this needle is the inability to obtain a bone core for biopsy ."
"cell populations in the bone marrow of the normal guinea-pig . quantitative data have been obtained for cell-populations in the bone marrow of the normal 400g guinea-pig based on a study of 25 animals . there was good agreement between two independent groups of observations and an average of 1880000 nucleated cells per c. mm. was found . of this total, 27 were lymphocytes, 31 granulocyte precursors and 26 nucleated erythrocyte precursors . whole body populations have been computed and the implications of the findings discussed ."
"pneumocystis carinii pneumonia.. case studies with electron microscopy . this paper deals with the clinicopathologic findings in 2 patients with pneumocystis carinii pneumonia . the first example was in a 51/2-month-old white female infant without an underlying disease . the second occurred, in association with cytomegalic inclusion disease of the lungs, in a 46-year-old white woman who had received steroid therapy, cytotoxic agents, and irradiation to the thorax for hodgkin's disease . an electron microscope was used for the study of the morphology of the organisms in tissue removed at autopsy ."
"the effect of dehydroepiandrosterone on the dehydroxycorticosteroids in the plasms in various stages of breast cancer and mastopathy . the depressing effect of dehydroepiandrosterone on plasma corticosteroids is, on an average, shortened in advanced breast cancer (stage iv) . the lowest corticosteroid values have been found with the three groups of patients 6 hours after infusion of dehydroepiandrosterone phosphate . the effect of dehydroepiandrosterone being, still provable after 12 hours with the group suffering from mastopathy, the breast cancer group of stage iv had at this time already reached the level of the initial values . the breast cancer group of stage iv had at this time already reached the level of the initial values . the breast cancer group of stage i/ii behaved intermediately . the less lasting effect of dehydroepiandrosterone is attributed to its accelerated transformation in advanced breast cancer ."
"the meaning of ph at low temperatures during extra-corporeal circulation a review of the temperature gradients occurring during profound hypothermia is made in regard to acid base changes in general, and to ph readings in particular . it is concluded that terms such as 'body', 'mean', 'average' and 'core' temperature should be discarded and that when a temperature is quoted it should be referred to the site at which it was measured . the main circumstances in which blood ph is measured at a temperature different from that at which the blood is equilibrated with respiratory gases are reviewed by describing the changes which occur during tonometry experiments . in this way fundamental changes can be understood before considering the more complicated sequences of events taking place in the living body . the alterations that occur in the concentrations of protein and bicarbonate ion when whole blood is cooled are reviewed, together with their influence on 'correction factors' . the reasons why these factors should not be applied to blood when the living body is undergoing hypothermia involving the use of an extra-corporeal circulation are discussed . examples of the numerical values for blood ph during the two main methods for producing profound hypothermia, one using autogenous lung perfusion and the other a pump-oxygenator are given, with reference to the influence of pco2 upon these values . the existing methods of acid-base measurement appear to be sufficiently accurate to reflect the metabolic component during profound hypothermia ."
"induced tumour resistance in rats . the human sarcoma hs has been grown in weanling rats treated with cortisone . this growth was modified by prior injection of various tissue antigens . active /immunity/ was produced by using human placenta or embryonic tissue as antigen, and similar results were obtained using suspensions of rapidly growing human tumours . the response to other human tissues varied.. foetal muscle and spleen were active, whereas adult plasma was inactive except from some patients with extensive malignant disease . passive protection was produced by using certain human sera at the time of challenging with hs . sera from five women who aborted showed this characteristic . where the pregnancy continued to term, antisubstances were not found,. and they were present in the puerperium in only two out of fifty cases . further groups of rats were given rat embryonic tissues as antigen, and the tumour challenge was then made with walker tumour,. the results were variable . with a benzpyrene-induced tumour in a pure line of /wag/ rat the effect was not obtained except in isolated cases . in experiments in mice, using as challenge an irondextran induced mouse sarcoma, prior injection with embryonic mouse liver or placenta increased the resistance to the growth of the tumour, but the tumour has not as yet been produced in a pure-line mouse . on the other hand mouse experiments, using as challenge the crocker tumour, proved negative . it is suggested that immune reactions may play a part in causing some abortions ."
"urinary steroid estimations in the prediction of response to adrenalectomy or hypophysectomy . a clinical trial has been carried out to test the use of the discriminant in assessing the suitability of patients with advanced breast cancer for hypophysectomy or adrenalectomy . patients with positive discriminants submitted to hypophysectomy have a much better prognosis than patients with negative discriminants submitted to adrenalectomy . patients selected for adrenalectomy because of negative discriminants have a significantly worse response to the operation than patients selected by random sample . patients selected for hypophysectomy because of positive discriminants tend to have a better response to the operation than do patients selected by random sample, but the difference is not significant . adrenalectomy is not recommended for patients with negative discriminants ."
"primary epidermoid cancer of the lung.. ultrastructural study . the early epidermoidic epithelioma of the human lung are initiated by the proliferation of body cells whose structure is analogical to that of the medium cells and/or the modificated basal cells of the normal bronchial wall . the presence of desmosomes and tonofibrils in the cells of the stratum germinativum of the bronchial epithelium and in the cells derived from it, allows us a better understanding of the malpighian metaplasis of this wall and gives account of the epidermoidic evolution of the bronchial epithelioma . certain nuclear and cytoplasmic modifications suggest the possibility of a causal virus ."
biosynthesis of glycoproteins i. incorporation of glucosamine- c into liver and plasma proteins of the rat . it has been shown that glucosamine-1- c administered intravenously to fed rats is rapidly removed from the blood stream and appears first as trichloroacetic acid-soluble derivatives in the tissues . this is followed by a conversion to macromolecules . at least 80 of the administered compound can be recovered in tissues . the liver is by far the most active organ in accumulating glucosamine . this is rapidly converted to protein-bound components of the liver particulate fraction (microsomes and mitochondria) and is then released to the plasma without appreciable accumulation in the soluble proteins of the liver . it is concluded that the glucosamine is transferred to the peptide chains of glycoproteins at some stage before these proteins are released from the liver particulate fraction .
acute experimental pneumococcal (type i) pneumonia in the mouse.. the migration of leucocytes from the pulmonary capillaries into the alveolar spaces as revealed by the electron microscope . in this preliminary study of experimental pneumococcal pulmonary pneumonia in the mouse the leucocytes were observed to pass from the capillaries into the interstitial tissue and eventually into the alveolar spaces through the intercellular junctions of the endothelial and epithelial cell membranes .
"a light and electron microscope study of developing respiratory tissue in the rat . 1. light microscopic observations on the development of the rat lung have shown the presence of glandular, canalicular and alveolar stages . 2. these same three stages can be identified by electron microscopy and all may be present in different parts of the lung at one time, e.g. at 40 and 45 mm. c.r. length . 3. in the glandular stage, the lung tissue itself has an immature appearance by light microscopy and by electron microscopy individual cells also are immature in respect of organelles . glycogen is present in immature cells . 4. during the canalicular stage, lung tissue becomes more vascular . 5. throughout all stages of development, the 'duct' or 'air' spaces are always lined by a continuous and complete epithelium, and blood vessels by a complete endothelium . 6. lamellated inclusion bodies are present in epithelial (endodermal) cells at an early stage of development . 7. micropinocytotic vesicles are present in large numbers in both epithelial and endothelial cytoplasm and it is suggested that in the foetus they may indicate absorption of amniotic fluid from alveolar spaces . 8. the mechanism of alveolar distension is discussed and its nature remains uncertain . 9. respiratory tissue of the rat is not fully differentiated at birth and the importance of this fact in human infants is discussed . 10. the adult blood-air barrier, consisting of epithelium, zona diffusa and endothelium, varies in thickness . this project was performed whilst both of us were in receipt of grants from the medical research council of canada, for which gratitude is expressed . our gratitude is also expressed to miss sylvia smith for typing the manuscript ."
"the pathogenesis of viral influenzal pneumonia in mice . the pathogenesis of influenzal pneumonia in mice was studied by electron microscopy . mice were inoculated with 1.5 ld of pr8 influenza virus and killed at varying intervals after inoculation . observations by light microscopy were correlated with those by electron microscopy in order to evaluate the lesions produced . at the periphery, the earliest lesions were focal areas of edema of alveolar lining cells, the capillary endothelium and the interposed basement membrane . this caused an appreciable thickening of the blood-air pathway . hypertrophy, degeneration and desquamation of the alveolar lining and proliferation of alveolar macrophages resulted in complete consolidation, which was progressive up to 1 week after infection . the central areas of the lung were affected somewhat differently . at 3 days after infection, the nonciliated bronchiolar cells showed considerable hyperplasia of endoplasmic reticulum and apical cytoplasmic edema . viral particles matured at the lumen surface of these cells and were then released into the bronchiolar lumen . the bronchiolar cells, both ciliated and nonciliated, underwent degeneration and sloughed into the bronchiolar lumen . the regenerating epithelium was stratified, and the surface cells were elongated and flattened . the peribronchiolar interstitial tissue gradually became totally infiltrated by cells, mostly of the mononuclear type ."
"studies on aging with horse crystalline lens gel as a contribution to biomorphosis of the mammalian crystalline lens . the effects of biomorphosis -dash the continuous material change in the chemical composition of the organs and tissues -dash are studied on the horse crystalline lens in respect of its amino acid content subject to substantial variations in the course of life . it is shown by electrophoretic and paperchromatographic methods that the qualitative composition of horse crystalline lenses remains quite the same, but that within the individual age stages there occur quantitative variations between the individual amino acids ."
"the role of alveolar inclusion bodies in the developing lung . the developing alveolar epithelium of man and rat contains characteristic inclusion bodies which are heterogeneous structures but basically consist of a system of membranous profiles and a limiting membrane of the unit type . inclusion bodies appear to result from focal cytoplasmic degradation which occurs in the rapidly changing cuboidal alveolar epithelium . some inclusion bodies in the developing rat lung are similar to the so-called /lamellar transformed mitochondria./ however, evidence is presented suggesting that alteration of all cytoplasmic membranes may be involved in the process of inclusion body formation . certain images associated with the golgi complex are interpreted as early forms of inclusion bodies . there is also evidence that inclusion bodies enlarge by accretion of membranes which finally are extruded into the alveolar space . inclusion bodies are formed and /secreted/ in greater number late in fetal life and in early infancy, i.e., at the time when the cuboidal alveolar epithelium is differentiating to the mature flattened type . the latter contains no inclusion bodies . on the basis of the morphologic characteristics of the inclusion bodies and the distribution of the acid phosphatase reaction, it is concluded that inclusion bodies are lysosomal structures active during remodeling of the developing alveolar epithelium . the possible interrelationship of inclusion bodies and pulmonary surfactant is discussed ."
"retinal detachment, cataract, keratoconus as ocular symptom complex in endogenous eczema . with reference to personal observations the authors describe the ovular changes encountered in endogenous eczema . besides the cataract which has been known to occur already for a long time, retinal detachment, keratoconus and keratoconjunctivitis do still belong to the symptom complex ."
"postural changes in blood distribution and its relation to the change in cardiac output . (1) cardiac output and the blood content indices of the several parts of the body were measured in 18 subjects including patients with various diseases using external radioisotope counting techniques . changes in these 2 parameters induced by standing were compared with each other . (2) average changes in blood distribution produced by standing were as follows . decrease in blood content in the /lung/ (-25 ) and in the /heart/ (-26 ) and increase in the /thigh/ (+56 ) were statistically significant . no significant change was revealed in the /head/, /palm/, /liver/ and /abdomen/ . (3) cardiac output and stroke volume decreased by standing in most of the cases . recent data were added to those reported previously and were treated statistically . average decrease in cardiac output was -13 in 6 control cases, -35 in 16 cases with neurocirculatory asthenia and -35 in 10 cases with hyperthyroidism . the difference was significant between control and neurocirculatory asthenia . standing induced a substantial increase in cardiac output in a case of idiopathic nodal rhythm, although there remains a doubt whether it is the ordinary response in this disease . (4) significant linear correlation was revealed between per cent change of blood content in the /thigh/ or in the /lung/ and that of cardiac output or stroke volume induced by standing . minimal blood shift was observed when the latter was extreme, and vice versa . this implies as follows.. reactivity of the heart might be influenced by posture, and transmural pressure of veins and or capillaries is probably adjusted, as in arterioles, to compensate for changes in cardiac output"
"comparative studies of the glycogen content of heart, liver and brain before and after iodine treatment and under conditions of asphyxia . blood sugar level and glycogen concentration in the heart, brain and liver of rabbits after treatment with inorganic iodine, depot insulin, iodine and insulin combined, hostacortine and hostacortine and iodine combined are being examined . a control group remains untreated . in a second test series the glycogen determination under asphyxia (the trachea is being pinched off for three minutes) is repeated . contrary to the brain the glycogen content of the heart muscle is not dependent upon the blood sugar level . after iodine treatment a lowering of the blood sugar becomes noticeable, but also an increase in heart glycogen . the liver glycogen shows greater variations . the levels achieved in these test series therefore show no significant differences during asphyxia there is a significant lowering of glycogen in all three organs . preliminary treatment with iodine succeeds in stopping the lowering of glycogen in the heart muscle and the brain . the possible causes for this phenomenon are being discussed ."
altered immunologic activity in sarcoidosis . studies in 16 patients with sarcoidosis revealed evidence of immunologic alterations other than impaired delayed hypersensitivity . transient impairment of the response of lymphocytes cultured from patients with sarcoidosis to phytohemagglutinin stimulation was found to parallel the clinical severity of the disease . the hemolytic activity of serum complement was increased . a disproportionate increase in serum iga was found characteristic of the hyperglobulinemia of sarcoidosis . these observations indicate that an altered immune response may be important in the pathogenesis of sarcoidosis . a simple hypothesis as to the specific kind of interaction of infectious agent and immunity which might result in the immunologic alterations observed is formulated and presented .
"electron microscopy of cytoplasmic inclusions within /macrophages/ of human tissue . the fine structure of inclusions found within the cytoplasm of macrophages of human lung, spleen, skin, lymph node, and rectum has been described . the inclusions appear as concentric or whorled lamellae arranged around a core . each lamella is constructed of discrete, parallel filaments . the inclusions do not resemble currently described viruses or virus-like particles, nor do they resemble asbestos bodies or other known atmospheric pollutants or ingestants . there is some resemblance to lipid phase systems as well as mast cell granules,. possibly the inclusions represent partial intracellular digestion of phagocytized tissue membranes or ingested mast cell granules, respectively . differences and similarities exist between the inclusion bodies of macrophages and the granules of mast cells . such variations could be due to alterations in mast cell granule morphology before or after macrophage ingestion . cytologic distinctions between macrophages laden with mast cell granules and mast cells proper, remains obscure and requires additional experimental evidence for clear electron microscopic differentiation of these two cell types . the exact nature of these highly structured bodies remains speculative"
"histological research on the lens in condition of hypoxia, changes in the mitotic activity of the epithelium . the effect of hypoxia on the mitotic activity of the cells of the lens epithelium was studied in 24 rats of the same strain and weight . the hypoxia was obtained in the decompression chamber . the results show that the mitotic activity of the lens epithelium is depressed at any of the examined altitudes (6.500, 8.000, 9.500 m),. in particular, a marked reduction in the number of the prophases and an accumulation in metaphase was observed . the results were examined from the statistical standpoint and discussed ."
"rate of change of carbon dioxide tension in arterial blood, jugular venous blood and cisternal cerebrospinal fluid on carbon dioxide administration . 1. the rate of change of p in arterial blood and cisternal c.s.f., was measured following 5 percent co administration in eight anaesthetized patients undergoing routine air encephalography . ventilation was maintained constant throughout the procedure by a respirator . in three of the experiments the rate of change of p in the jugular venous blood was also measured . 2. the rise in p varied between 25.7 and 14.8 mm hg . the final samples of blood and c.s.f. were taken 20-25 min after the start of co administration in five experiments . at this time the mean rise in p was 65.9 (maximum range 68.1-61.6 percent) of the rise in p . in the remaining three experiments the final samples were taken at 15 min when the rises in p were 53.2, 39.4 and 38.1 percent of the arterial change . 3. the increases in p were 57.5, 76.2 and 76.1 percent of those in the arterial blood . the changes in p in the c.s.f. were smaller than in the jugular venous blood in all three experiments . in two of the experiments the final samples were taken 15 min after the start of co administration when the increases of p in the c.s.f. were 68.5 percent and 50 percent of those in jugular venous blood . in one experiment where the final samples were taken at 20 min the increase in p was 89 percent of the rise in p . 4. there was a delay, following the start of co administration, in the rise of p in jugular venous blood and in the c.s.f . this delay was about 1 min in the jugular venous blood but in the c.s.f. it varied from 1.6 to 4.2 min (mean 2.3) . 5. the rise of p in blood and c.s.f. was exponential . the rise in p in all experiments consisted of a fast component with time constants which varied between 0.2 and 0.9 min (mean 0.5) and a slow component with time constants varying between 6.7 and 14.7 (mean 11.6) . the rise in p and p consisted of only one component . the time constants for the changes in jugular venous blood were 2.1, 3.8 and 4.3 min, whilst in the c.s.f. they varied between 6.7 and 14.7 (mean 11.6) . 6. it is probable that about 40 percent of the increase in ventilation following co administration is due to stimulation of an area in the antero-lateral surface of the medulla sensitive to changes in ph or p (mitchell et al. 1963) . this area is superficial and ventilation is affected by changes in the p of the overlying c.s.f . it can be predicted from our experiments that the rise in p on co administration will take some 30 min to be complete . this may explain the slow rise in ventilation on co breathing when compared with the rate of rise of arterial and jugular venous p ."
"studies on the compound lipids from x-ray irradiated animal, ii. biological and biochemical properties of the compound lipids in the x-ray irradiated rabbit organs . for the purpose to clarify the causes of x-ray disturbances a series of experiments have been conducted on biological and biochemical properties of compound lipids extracted from normal and x-ray irradiated rabbit organs with a special reference to the p -labeled compound lipids uptake, inhibitory action to l cell proliferation and uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation, and the following results have been obtained the compound lipids (lysophosphatide rich fraction) isolated from the x-ray irradiated rabbit organ have been found to possess a strong hemolytic action and also an action to inhibit the cell proliferation as well as to accelerate the respiration of the mitochondria in the rabbit liver and spleen . it has also been proven that they act as to induce a marked swelling of mitochondria, to impede the formation of high energy phosphate as well as to act as an uncoupler of oxidative phosphorylation in vivo . in the test to see the uptake of p -labeled compound lipids by various organs, a marked uptake has been observed in spleen, bone marrow, and liver of both irradiated and non-irradiated groups . further, the uptake of p -labeled compound lipids in the rabbits given intravenous injections of compound lipid fraction for 30 consecutive days previously has been found to be greatest in pancreas followed by bone marrow, spleen, liver in the order mentioned in male group, whereas it is greatest in spleen, followed by liver and bone marrow in the female group . with these results the discussion was conducted concerning the relation between the lipid metabolism and x-ray disturbances ."
"cesium-131 uptake and distribution in the human heart.. an analysis of cardiac scans in 104 patients . when properly used, cesium-131 is a satisfactory agent for the study of cardiac morphology by photoscanning, which we believe is a useful adjunctive diagnostic procedure in patients for whom the results of other methods of evaluation are at variance with the clinical symptoms of cardiac disease . the studies reported here suggest that perhaps infarction of a subclinical type, size, or location may occur earlier than has been previously thought and that the damage it leaves may not be detectable by any means other than autopsy or a technique such as scanning . we have not yet been able to measure the actual concentration of cesium-131 in the heart at autopsy so that the cold and cool areas could be examined by histologic sections ."
"oxygen consumption of paralysed men exposed to cold . 1. oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide output were measured when human subjects were cooled for 80-210 min . two subjects were normal, one had been almost completely paralysed below the neck by poliomyelitis, and two were unconscious as a result of intracranial damage and were observed with and without paralysing doses of muscle relaxants (d-tubocurarine and gallamine) . 2. when normal subjects and unconscious subjects receiving no drugs were cooled, oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide output rose . 3. when subjects paralysed by disease or drugs were cooled, oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide output were not increased . 4. these observations are consistent with the view that in man the increase in metabolism on cooling for periods up to 31/2 hr occurs solely in skeletal muscle ."
"heparin levels during and after hypothermic perfusion . 1. perfusion-temperature influences the rate of heparin-loss during extracorporeal circulation, and therefore, the requirement of re-heparinization . 2. heparin half-lives of approximately 13/4 hours and 21/2 hours were calculated during perfusions conducted at average temperatures of 31.5 and 22.6 c. respectively . 3. the rate of heparin-loss during extracorporeal circulation is inconstant in an individual, and variable between individuals, so that exact neutralization requires an accurate estimation of the heparin concentration present at the end of perfusion . 4. the protamine titration test provides a crude but simple and satisfactory means of monitoring free-heparin levels . 5. complete neutralization of heparin is an important factor in minimizing postoperative blood losses . 6. protamine is a less efficient neutralizing agent than polybrene at the same dosage level . it may be most effective in divided dosage . 7. /rebound/ was detected in 5 of 45 cases studied, although in only one instance was it of a degree likely to be significant . 8. significant prolongation of the clotting-time resulting from excess neutralizing agent, was not evident in this study ."
"platelet sequestration in man . i. methods . current methods of labeling platelets with chromium using ethylenediamine tetraacetate (edta) as an anticoagulant were found to cause rapid hepatic sequestration of nearly all the transfused platelets about 50 returned to the circulation but then were partially destroyed in the spleen . less than one-third survived . evidence is presented which indicates that edta is injurious to platelets . when an acid-citrate medium that buffered plasma at ph 6.5 was used as an anticoagulant, 36 to 85 of the labeled platelets survived (average, 62 ), and marked temporary sequestration did not occur . studies in thrombocytopenic persons showed that circulating platelet cr activity measures the true survival of such transfused platelets . the survival and sequestration of platelets were studied in normal subjects . the survival data support the concept that platelets die chiefly by a process of senescence . external scintillation scanning of the various organs suggests that normally the majority of platelets is destroyed in the liver ."
"acute leukemia associated with phenylbutazone treatment.. a review of the literature and report of a further case . the possible toxic reactions to phenylbutazone have been listed, and a review of the literature of haematological complications has shown that 16 deaths attributable to agranulocytosis, aplastic anaemia and thrombocytopenia have been recorded . the association between leukaemia and phenylbutazone first suggested by bean (1960) has been amplified by further reports, which have been reviewed . a further case history has been presented . of the 15 patients with acute leukaemia in which the association has been recorded, there were other possible leukaemogenic factors in three, and in a further three the drug had been given for only a short time before the leukaemia was diagnosed . however, in the remaining nine, the histories are such that the phenylbutazone ingestion may have been associated with the development of the leukaemia . further studies, which should include matched controls, are indicated, and will be required before a definite opinion can be given as to any causal relationship between the drug and the disease ."
"absorbed radiation dose and excretion of cesium-131 in humans . data relating to the effective half-life, absorbed dose of radiation, and excretion rates of cesium-131 have been presented . cesium-131 is an excellent material for cardiac scanning, since a very low amount of radiation is absorbed -dash a dose of the order of one twentieth that received in diagnostic x-ray studies of the gastrointestinal tract . absorption of radiation can be reduced further by the administration of a thiazide type of diuretic and, probably, by catharsis after the scan ."
"radiocardiography.. principles and methods . the aa show the importance of radiocardiography, as a method to evaluate the cardiac output, the ventricular volumes and the pulmonary blood volume . in this first paper, they are particulary concerned with some technical aspects, which are very important to collect data . the position of the collimator on the precordium, the injection of isotopes through a catheter, just behind the ventricle near the tricuspid valve, the selection of ratemeter constants the velocity of paper on the recorder and the way to read the area of the curve, were specially discussed . finally, they present the formula used to calculate cardiac output, ventricular volumes and pulmonary blood volumes ."
"reaction of the adrenal cortex during controlled experimental hypothermia . the stress reaction caused by hypothermia was studied in rabbits subjected to controlled hypothermia by immersion in an icebath . some of the animals were re-warmed . to anesthetize the animals, pentobarbitone sodium (nembutal) was given intraperitoneally, and, in some cases, followed by ether anesthesia . further, the stress reaction produced by pentobarbitone alone was studied in five animals, and that of ether anesthesia alone in three . no anesthesia was given to the three rabbits placed in the refrigerator . the variation in distribution and amount of adrenocortical lipids served as an indicator for evaluation of the stress reaction . in all the hypothermia tests there occurred changes in the distribution and amount of cortical lipids, denoting a stress reaction brought about by hypothermia . in rabbits, the barbiturate did not seem to inhibit the stress reaction . this may be attributed partly to the test animal, as such and partly to the fact that shivering of some extent always occurred during the hypothermia experiments ."
"use of a cross-circulation technique in studying respiratory responses to co . the effect of hypercapnia and hypocapnia on ventilation was investigated in cross-circulated dogs in which the recipient dog's head and neck regions were perfused by blood from a donor dog . hypercapnia of the donor dog was produced by administering co -o -n gas mixtures in the inspired air . hypocapnia was produced by hyperventilating the donor dog with the aid of a respiratory pump . when the donor dog was hyperventilated, the ventilation of the recipient was maintained at or just below its resting level and it was independent of the arterial pco of the donor . the donor dog was apneic when the artificial hyperventilation was suspended and this response was not abolished by vagotomy . bilateral vagotomy caused an increase in ventilation in the recipient when its head was perfused by hypocapnic blood . bilateral removal of the carotid receptors did not influence the response to co qualitatively although there was some reduction in the ventilation of the recipient to cephalic hypercapnia . the ventilation of the recipient dog was best correlated to the ph and pco of its cerebrospinal fluid in both hypercapnic and hypocapnic states ."
"action of phytohaemagglutinin in vitro on the lymphocytes of chronic lymphoid leukaemia . the in vitro action of phytohaemagglutinin has been the subjects of a comparative investigation of the lymphocytes of 13 normal subjects and of 15 cases of chronic lymphatic leukaemia . in both groups there is cellular change shown by the appearance of large basophil nucleolated cells showing mitotic activity . in all the cases of lymphatic leukaemia the percentage of cells undergoing such change is lower than in normal subjects, and the transformation occurs more slowly . the two phenomena are more striking the higher the initial leucocytosis . these results suggest, in chronic lymphatic leukaemia, the cells affected by the transformation are residual normal lymphoid elements . leukaemic lymphoid cells appear to be incapable of this transformation ."
"demonstration of ventricular aneurysms by radioisotope scanning . radioisotope scanning of the cardiac blood pool after the intravenous injection of i -labeled iodipamide was carried out in 14 patients with ventricular aneurysm . in 4, the aneurysm could be demonstrated on neither the anteroposterior chest roentgenogram nor the scan . in 5, the aneurysm was apparent on the radiograph, but the blood pool did not enter the area, suggesting a thrombus within the aneurysm . in 5, the aneurysm was detectable on the film and was also seen to be filled with radioactivity on the scan . presumably these findings showed that a thrombus had not yet formed . blood pool radioisotope scanning appears to be another tool in the diagnosis of ventricular aneurysm, useful also in demonstrating in some patients the presence or absence of an intraluminal clot within the aneurysm ."

"attitudinal factors in congenital heart disease . this study considers the behavioral implications of congenital heart disease for the pediatric patient, his siblings, and his parents . the effects of a disease on the child, on his siblings, and on his parents and the interplay among these individuals are explored . the impact of the physician's diagnosis is illustrated by the induced significant changes in family attitudes, which are not necessarily related to disease severity or child incapacity . poorer adjustment and anxiety in the cardiac child related more highly to maternal anxiety and pampering than to his degree of incapacity . maternal protectiveness and pampering were significantly greater in the cardiac than in the normal group and were highest in the cyanotic group the best predictor of maternal protectiveness was maternal anxiety, and it was found that the addition of other variables such as incapacity and child dependence failed to improve prediction substantially . maternal anxiety seemed related to the presence rather than to the severity of the heart condition ."
"maternal anxiety during pregnancy and adequacy of mother and child adjustment eight months following childbirth . fifty pregnant women were administered a battery of psychological tests . on the basis of scores obtained from the manifest anxiety scale, these pregnant women were dichotomized into a /high anxiety/ group and a /low anxiety/ group . eight months following childbirth, the mothers and children were seen for a psychological assessment . it was found that the women in the /high anxious/ group evidenced significantly more negative childrearing attitudes . that is, the /high anxious/ mothers obtained significantly higher scores on the hostility and control factors measured by the pari . on the basis of the examiner's ratings of the mother's personality traits, it was found that the women who were highly anxious during pregnancy received much less favorable personality ratings at the time of the 8-month assessment . moreover, there was a significant difference in the proportions of mothers in the two groups who received a favorable rating from the examiner on the basis of his observation of the mother-child interaction during the session . in studying the children of these mothers, it was found that the children of the /low anxious/ mothers received a significantly higher developmental quotient on the infant mental scale . in keeping with this finding, they also obtained a higher developmental quotient on the motor scale, although on this aspect of the intellectual assessment the difference was not statistically significant . also, the children from the /low anxious/ mothers tended to receive a score indicative of a more favorable general emotional tone than did the offspring of the /high anxious/ mothers . this difference between the two groups of children was not statistically significant . in general, the findings were consistent with the predictions that the children who were being reared by women who had been highly anxious during pregnancy would fare less well on tests of intellectual development and indices of emotional adjustment . the findings also were in keeping with the prediction that the highly anxious women during pregnancy would evidence less desirable parental attitudes during their child's early development and that they would present a less favorable personality picture at a time approximately 8 months following pregnancy ."
"maternal separation in the rhesus monkey . the present study involved separation of eight monkey mother-infant pairs for a period of two weeks and measurement of the behavior of the infants before, during and after reunion with their mothers, and of the mothers before and after reunion . all infants showed emotional disturbance in response to separation and drastic decreases in play and other complex social behaviors while separated . it is clear that infant-mother separation produces emotional disturbance in both human and macaque infants and that the patterns of responses following separation are similar in both species . the results obtained in studies of monkey infant-mother separation indicate that sheer physical separation is the crucial aspect of maternal separation for monkeys . undoubtedly other factors associated with separation from the mother are vitally important for human children, and may account in part for the absence or rarity of the detachment stage (as seen in human response pattern) in separated monkey infants . the overall results show considerable similarity in the responses of human children and infant monkeys to separation from the mother ."

"experimental investigation of the aerodynamics of a wing in a slipstream . an experimental study of a wing in a propeller slipstream was made in order to determine the spanwise distribution of the lift increase due to slipstream at different angles of attack of the wing and at different free stream to slipstream velocity ratios .  the results were intended in part as an evaluation basis for different theoretical treatments of this problem . the comparative span loading curves, together with supporting evidence, showed that a substantial part of the lift increment produced by the slipstream was due to a /destalling/ or boundary-layer-control effect .  the integrated remaining lift increment, after subtracting this destalling lift, was found to agree well with a potential flow theory . an empirical evaluation of the destalling effects was made for the specific configuration of the experiment ."
"simple shear flow past a flat plate in an incompressible fluid of small viscosity . in the study of high-speed viscous flow past a two-dimensional body it is usually necessary to consider a curved shock wave emitting from the nose or leading edge of the body .  consequently, there exists an inviscid rotational flow region between the shock wave and the boundary layer .  such a situation arises, for instance, in the study of the hypersonic viscous flow past a flat plate .  the situation is somewhat different from prandtl's classical boundary-layer problem . in prandtl's original problem the inviscid free stream outside the boundary layer is irrotational while in a hypersonic boundary-layer problem the inviscid free stream must be considered as rotational .  the possible effects of vorticity have been recently discussed by ferri and libby .  in the present paper, the simple shear flow past a flat plate in a fluid of small viscosity is investigated .  it can be shown that this problem can again be treated by the boundary-layer approximation, the only novel feature being that the free stream has a constant vorticity .  the discussion here is restricted to two-dimensional incompressible steady flow ."

"the effect of controlled three-dimensional roughness on boundary layer transition at supersonic speeds . experiments were performed in the 12-in. supersonic wind tunnel of the jet propulsion laboratory of the california institute of technology to investigate the effect of three-dimensional roughness elements (spheres) on boundary-layer transition on a tained at local mach numbers of 1.90, 2.71, and 3.67 by varying trip size, position, spacing, and reynolds number per inch . the results indicate that (1) transition from laminar to turbulent flow induced by three-dimensional roughness elements begins when the double row of spiral vortices trailing each element contaminates and breaks down the surrounding field of vorticity, (2) transition appears rather suddenly, becoming more violent with increasing roughness height relative to the boundary-layer thickness, (3) after the breakdown of the vorticity field, the strength of the spiral vortices may still persist in the sublayer of the ensuing turbulent flow, (4) lateral spacing of roughness elements has little effect upon the initial breakdown (contamination) of the laminar flow, and (5) the trip reynolds number where u and v are the velocity and kinematic viscosity at the outer edge of the boundary layer and k is roughness height, such that transition occurs at the roughness position, varies as the position reynolds number to the one-fourth power, viz., where x is trip position ."

"similarity laws for stressing heated wings . it will be shown that the differential equations for a heated plate with large temperature gradient and for a similar plate at constant temperature can be made the same by a proper modification of the thickness and the loading for the isothermal plate . this fact leads to the result that the stresses in the heated plate can be calculated from measured strains on the unheated plate by a series of relations, called the /similarity laws ./  the application of this analog theory to solid wings under aerodynamic heating is discussed in detail .  the loading on the unheated analog wing is, however, complicated and involves the novel concept of feedback and /body force/ loading .  the problem of stressing a heated box-wing structure can be solved by the same analog method and is briefly discussed ."
"piston theory - a new aerodynamic tool for the aeroelastician . representative applications are described which illustrate the extent to which simplifications in the solutions of high-speed unsteady aeroelastic problems can be achieved through the use of certain aerodynamic techniques known collectively as /piston theory ./  based on a physical model originally proposed by hayes and lighthill, piston theory for airfoils and finite wings has been systematically developed by landahl, utilizing expansions in powers of the thickness ratio and the inverse of the flight mach number m .  when contributions of orders and are negligible, the theory predicts a point-function relationship between the local pressure on the surface of a wing and the normal component of fluid velocity produced by the wing's motion .  the computation of generalized forces in aeroelastic equations, such as the flutter determinant, is then always reduced to elementary integrations of the assumed modes of motion . essentially closed-form solutions are given for the bending- torsion and control-surface flutter properties of typical section airfoils at high mach numbers .  these agree well with results of more exact theories wherever comparisons can be fairly made . moreover, they demonstrate the increasingly important influence of thickness and profile shape as m grows larger, a discovery that would be almost impossible using other available aerodynamic tools .  the complexity of more practical flutter analyses-e.g., on three-dimensional wings and panels-is shown to be substantially reduced by piston theory .  an iterative procedure is outlined, by which improved flutter eigenvalues can be found through the successive introduction of higher-order terms in and  . other applications to unsteady supersonic problems are reviewed, including gust response and rapid maneuvers of elastic aircraft .  steady-state aeroelastic calculations are also discussed, but for them piston theory amounts only to a slight modification of ackeret's formulas . suggestions are made regarding future research based on the new aerodynamic method, with particular emphasis on areas where computational labor can be reduced with a minimum loss of precision .  it is pointed out that a mach number zone exists where thermal effects are appreciable but nonlinear viscous interactions may be neglected, and that in this zone piston theory is the logical way of estimating air loads when analyzing aerodynamic- thermoelastic interaction problems ."
"on two-dimensional panel flutter . theory and experiments of the flutter of a buckled plate are discussed .  it is shown that an increase in the initial deviation from flatness or a static pressure differential across the plate raises the critical value of the /reduced velocity ./ the applicability of the galerkin method to the linearized problem of flutter of an unbuckled plate has been questioned by several authors .  in this paper the flutter condition was formulated in the form of an integral equation and solved numerically by the method of iteration and the method of matrix approximations, thus avoiding the constraint of assumed modes .  for a plate (with finite bending rigidity) the results confirm those given by the galerkin method . an approximate analysis of the limiting form and amplitude of the flutter motion for a buckled plate is presented ."

"remarks on the eddy viscosity in compressible mixing flows . in connection with a study of the wakes behind bodies in hypersonic flow carried out for the missile and space vehicle division of the general electric company, it was desired to estimate the eddy viscosity in axisymmetric, compressible wakes .  because of the lack of applicable experimental data, it was found necessary to make such an estimate by rationally extending the few available data for incompressible flows to the compressible case .  this suggested the application and extension of the transformations applied to turbulent boundary layers in reference infinitesimal mass are invariant with transformation, mager showed that the partial differential equations for the compressible turbulent boundary layer can be transformed to incompressible form .  the validity of this assumption and of the transformations was established for several boundary-layer flows by comparison with experiment ."

"theory of stagnation point heat transfer in dissociated air . the boundary-layer equations are developed in general for the case of very high speed flight where the external flow is in a dissociated state .  in particular the effects of diffusion and of atom recombination in the boundary layer are included .  it is shown that at the stagnation point the equations can be reduced exactly to a set of nonlinear ordinary differential equations even when the chemical reactions proceed so slowly that the boundary layer is not in thermochemical equilibrium . two methods of numerical solution of these stagnation point equations are presented, one for the equilibrium case and the other for the nonequilibrium case .  numerical results are correlated in terms of the parameters entering the numerical formulation so as not to depend critically on the physical assumptions made . for the nonequilibrium boundary layer, both catalytic (to atom recombination) and noncatalytic wall surfaces are considered .  a solution is represented which shows the transition from the /frozen/ boundary layer (very slow recombination rates) to the equilibrium boundary layer (fast recombination rates) . a recombination rate parameter is introduced to interpret the nonequilibrium results, and it is shown that a scale factor is involved in relating the equilibrium state of a boundary layer on bodies of different sizes . it is concluded that the heat transfer through the equilibrium stagnation point boundary layer can be computed accurately by a simple correlation formula and that the heat transfer is almost unaffected by a nonequilibrium state of the boundary layer provided the wall is catalytic and the lewis number near unity ."
"inviscid hypersonic flow over blunt-nosed slender bodies . at hypersonic speeds the drag area of a blunt nose is much larger than the drag area of a slender afterbody, and the energy contained in the flow field in a plane at right angles to the flight direction is nearly constant over a downstream distance many times greater than the characteristic nose dimension .  the transverse flow field exhibits certain similarity properties directly analogous to the flow similarity behind an intense blast wave found by g. i. taylor, s. c. lin, and a. sakurai .  a comparison with the experiments of hammitt, vas, and bogdonoff on a flat plate with a blunt leading edge at in helium shows that the shock-wave shape is predicted very accurately by this similarity analysis .  the predicted surface pressure distribution is somewhat less satisfactory .  experimental results on a hemisphere-cylinder obtained at in the galcit air tunnel indicate that not only the shock-wave shape but also the surface pressures for this body are given very closely by the similarity theory, except near the hemisphere-cylinder junction . energy considerations combined with a detailed study of the equations of motion show that flow similarity is also possible for a class of bodies of the form, provided that, where for a two-dimensional body and for a body of revolution .  when the shock shape is not similar to the body shape, and the entire flow field some distance from the nose must depend to some extent on the details of the nose geometry . by again utilizing energy and drag considerations one finds that at hypersonic speeds the inviscid surface pressures generated by a blunt leading edge are larger than the pressures induced by boundary-layer growth on an insulated flat surface for an insulated blunt-nosed slender body of revolution the corresponding distance is given by .  (here is free-stream reynolds number based on leading-edge thickness, or nose diameter .)  in free flight these constants are replaced by 1,700 and 20, respectively, so that viscous interaction effects are important over the forward portion of a blunt- nosed slender body only for relatively low values of . however, /far downstream/ of the nose the inviscid over-pressure is small and viscous interaction phenomena will have to be taken into account ."

"a simple model study of transient temperature and thermal stress distribution due to aerodynamic heating . the present work is concerned with the determination of transient temperatures and thermal stresses in simple models intended to simulate parts or the whole of an aircraft structure of the built- up variety subjected to aerodynamic heating . the first case considered is that of convective heat transfer into one side of a flat plate, representing a thick skin, and the effect of the resulting temperature distribution in inducing thermal stresses associated with bending restraint at the plate edges . numerical results are presented for the transient temperature differentials in the plate when the environment temperature first increases linearly with time and then remains constant, the period of linear increase representing the time of acceleration of the aircraft .  corresponding thermal stress information is presented . the second case is that of the wide-flanged i-beam with convective heat transfer into the outer faces of the flanges .  numerical results are presented for transient temperature differentials for a wide range of values of the applicable parameters and for an environment temperature variation as described above . corresponding thermal stresses in a beam of infinite length are determined .  a theoretical analysis of the stress distribution in a beam of finite length is carried out and numerical results obtained for one case .  an experimental investigation of temperatures and stresses in such a beam is described, and results are presented which indicate good agreement with corresponding theoretical results ."

"the dynamic motion of a missile descending through the atmosphere . a method is presented for computing rapidly, yet accurately, the dynamic motion of a ballistic-type missile descending through the atmosphere .  the equations of motion are separated into a set of /static/ trajectory equations (zero angle of attack) and a set of /rotational/ equations describing the oscillatory motion of the missile about its center of gravity .  a transformation allows the rotational equations to be written in a manner analogous to the equation for an undamped oscillating spring mass system with the mass equal to unity and a time variable spring constant .  for given initial conditions this equation can be solved to obtain the envelope of maximum angle of attack .  an additional transformation allows the calculation of the complete oscillatory motion at any time during the trajectory as a function of the maximum angle of attack at that time . this solution shows that the maximum angle of attack of a missile descending through the atmosphere at relatively constant speed is reduced even when the aerodynamic damping is neglected ."
"the prospects for magneto-aerodynamics . the equations describing the flow of an electrically conducting fluid in the presence of electric and magnetic fields are written down with the aid of certain simplifications appropriate to aeronautical applications .  in order to estimate the probable significance of magneto-aerodynamic effects, some data on conductivity of pure and /seeded/ air are first examined . dimensionless quantities representing the ratios of forces and of currents are then formed and their values studied for conditions of flight in the atmosphere . some examples of magneto-hydrodynamic and magneto- gasdynamic effects in simple flows are given .  these include two cases of poiscuille flow of conducting liquids with applied magnetic fields and the case of quasi-one-dimensional gas flow with applied electrical and magnetic fields .  in the last case, attractive possibilities are found for controlled acceleration or deceleration of gas at subsonic and supersonic speeds, even in constant-area channels .  the behavior of the flow is characteristically different in different regimes of mach number and flow speed relative to certain /significant speeds/ that are dependent on the ratio of electrical to magnetic field strengths .  these are studied, and a chart is constructed to relate the length to the speed ratio of a maximum-acceleration constant-area channel . it is concluded that the advantages that may accrue from magneto-aerodynamic methods are sufficiently attractive to justify the considerable research and engineering development that will be required .  among the unsolved engineering problems are the reduction of surface resistance of electrodes in contact with a conducting gas, development of techniques for seeding, and provision of the required magnetic fields in flight ."
"constant-temperature magneto-gasdynamic channel flow . in the course of investigating boundary-layer flow in continuous plasma accelerators with crossed electric and magnetic fields, it was found advantageous to have at hand simple closed-form solutions for the magneto-gasdynamic flow in the duct which could serve as free-stream conditions for the boundary layers .  nontrivial solutions of this sort are not available at present, and in fact, as in the work of resler and sears, the variation of conditions along the flow axis must be obtained through numerical integration . consequently, some simple solutions of magneto-gasdynamic channel flow were sought, possessing sufficient algebraic simplicity to serve as free-stream boundary conditions for analytic investigations of the boundary layer in a physically reasonable accelerator . in particular, since the cooling of the accelerator tube is likely to be an important physical problem because of the high gas temperatures required to provide sufficient gaseous conductivity, channel flow with constant temperature appears interesting . some simple algebraic solutions for the case of a constant temperature plasma are developed in the following paragraphs ."
"stagnation point of a blunt body in hypersonic flow . the purpose of this paper is to present a method of calculation devised to yield all the important information on the symmetric inviscid hypersonic flow in the stagnation point region of a blunt body .  the problem is the same as that considered by hayes who used a slightly different approach .  it is demonstrated that hayes' results are valid in the stagnation point region and can hence be considered a basis for constructing less restricted solutions . equations are presented giving velocity, pressure, detachment distance, and vorticity .  the values of shock detachment distance and body pressure coefficient are compared with experimental data for spheres .  the pressure comparison shows that the results of hayes and the theory presented herein represent a better approximation than the newtonian impact theory for hypersonic mach numbers . in conclusion, the possibility of refinements to this analysis is discussed ."
"supersonic flow around blunt bodies . the newtonian theory of impact has been shown to be useful for pressure calculations on the forward facing part of bodies moving at high speed .  it is now a familiar practice to use this information to calculate nonviscous velocities at the wall and then to estimate rates of heat transfer .  this procedure is perhaps open to question,. heat-transfer rates depend on velocity gradients which are not given by the newtonian analysis .  nor can one obtain information on boundary-layer stability or all the body stability derivatives .  it seems, therefore, inevitable that, as design proceeds with these hypersonic missiles, there will be a greater need for more accurate aerodynamic theories either to predict what will happen in unfamiliar flight conditions or to effect an extrapolation from a known test result to the design condition ."
"a new technique for investigating heat transfer and surface phenomena under hypersonic flow conditions . on the forebody of many practically interesting hypersonic vehicles, there is little interaction between the inviscid flow field and the boundary layer .  therefore, inviscid flow theory can be used to determine, independent of surface phenomena, the physically interesting quantities such as shock shape, shock detachment distance, sonic line shape, and pressure distribution . furthermore, the pressure distribution so determined can then be used for the study of heat transfer, materials behavior, and other surface phenomena .  thus, for these bodies, the prandtl boundary-layer concept can be utilized for the calculation of both the inviscid flow and the boundary-layer behavior . it is the purpose of this note to point out that this concept can also be applied experimentally in order to provide, in conjunction with a conventional hypersonic wind-tunnel air supply, a means for investigating hypersonic heat transfer and surface phenomena under conditions of flight reynolds numbers ."

"on the flow of a sonic stream past an airfoil surface . this study of the flow about an airfoil in a near-sonic stream indicates the important factors determining the pressure distribution on the airfoil .  analysis of the mach wave pattern suggests that the supersonic domain of the flow can be derived from two simple-wave flows, one arising from the mach waves reflected at the sonic line and the other from the changes in airfoil surface slope .  the compressive effect of the reflected mach waves is determined quantitatively as a function of airfoil leading-edge geometry from an analysis of measured pressure distributions for uncambered airfoils,. and it is shown how this can be superimposed on the wave system from the curved surface to give an equivalent simple-wave flow over the airfoil . an application of this scheme to the calculation of the pressure distribution over an airfoil in a sonic stream gives results in good agreement with experiment ."
"experiments on boundary layer transition at supersonic speeds . tests were conducted in the 12-in. continuous supersonic wind tunnel of the jet propulsion laboratory, california institute of technology, to determine the effects of surface cooling on boundary-layer transition at supersonic speeds .  the effects of cooling were investigated at test section mach numbers of 1.97, smooth cone in the presence of three levels of supply-stream turbulence (0.4, 2, and 9 per cent) and several single-element roughnesses at fixed axial location .  transition data were obtained optically by means of a magnified-schlieren system .  the results, for the range of mach number investigated, indicate that (1) transition on a smooth cone can definitely be delayed by surface cooling, (2) transition promoted by either supply-stream turbulence or surface roughness can also be delayed by surface cooling depending upon degree of turbulence or relative roughness respectively, and (3) the adverse effects of increased turbulence and roughness decrease with increasing mach number ."

"the gyroscopic effect of a rigid rotating propeller on engine and wing vibration modes . in many wing vibration analyses it is found necessary to take into account the effect of flexibly mounted engines .  hence, it is reasonable to ask what vibratory gyroscopic effect this flexibility may give rise to when propellers are whirling .  an engine mount may be thought of as a horizontal beam cantilevered from the wing, having both horizontal and vertical flexibility . if this beam were infinitely rigid horizontally, then, when it vibrated, the gyroscopic moments induced in the propeller due to the resultant pitching motion of its axis would not produce propeller axis yaw .  however, engine-mount lateral stiffness tical stiffness, so that gyroscopic effects will play a role as the propeller axis undergoes pitching vibrations at the tip of the cantilever engine mount .  the purpose of this paper is to investigate this role under the assumption that the propeller itself is a rigid disc . the paper is divided into four parts .  part (1) deals briefly with classical gyroscope theory .  part (2) presents engine vibration mode studies-experimental photographic techniques on a model gyroscope mounted at the ends of two different cantilever beams .  part (3) presents the theory of the coupled motion of an elastic wing upon which a gyroscope is mounted to simulate an engine-propeller system on an airplane .  part (4) consists of an example of the theory of part (3), in which, by taking what are thought to be reasonable parameters, results are obtained showing how the whirling of a rigid propeller may materially affect wing normal mode shapes and frequencies ."
"the relation between wall temperature and the effect of roughness on boundary layer transition . the experimentally demonstrated rise and subsequent fall of transition reynolds number with decreasing wall- to-ambient temperature ratio has been the subject of two recent notes .  in both cases it was argued that the increased effectiveness of roughness due to wall cooling was not sufficient to explain the transition-reversal phenomenon on nominally smooth bodies .  in one case, the criterion for transition reversal was taken to be and in the other values of as low as eter is a reynolds number formed from velocity and kinematic viscosity based on calculated conditions at the height of roughness element k in the undisturbed, laminar boundary layer at the station of roughness location .  the present note is submitted to show that another method for evaluating the effect of roughness on transition leads to an opposite conclusion ."
"tip-bluntness effects on cone pressures at m=6.85 . there is, at present, considerable interest in the characteristies of blunted bodies from both an aerodynamic and a heat-transfer standpoint .  the use of blunt shapes is contemplated to reduce the heat-transfer problem at body noses, but there are also applications for blunt noses which occur from mainly aerodynamic considerations .  an actual reduction in drag may be the beneficial result of blunting the nose of a cone or a similar slender shape under certain conditions .  although the sphere has received considerable treatment, the nose shapes are not necessarily tangent spheres .  in the case, let us say, of a total head tube situated in the nose of a given body, the blunting may be quite flat, and nose sections blunter than spherical shape may conceivably be desirable, in some cases, from the heat- transfer standpoint . the purpose of the present investigation is to examine the aerodynamic effect of a simple type of nose blunting on a basic body . the incompressible flow of an electrically conducting fluid past a porous plate y = 0 with constant suction velocity in the presence of a transverse uniform strength has recently been investigated by gupta .  in this note, the problem is generalized to take into account the effect of free convection, when a body force g per unit mass is acting in the negative x-direction parallel to the wall .  the fluid is assumed to be semi- incompressible as usual .  in addition to the obvious practical significance, this problem is also interesting in the sense that it provides another exact solution of the magnetohydrodynamic equations, since the only electromagnetic assumptions involved are constant properties and freedom from excessive charges ."
"an investigation of separated flows, part ii: flow in the cavity and heat transfer . the first portion of this paper describes studies of the internal structure of the separated flow in a notch at a free-stream mach number of 3 .  observations include..  flow visualization, spark- schlieren pictures of the fluctuations of the free shear layer, and studies of the diffusion of heat from sources placed in the separated region .  the second part describes measurements of local heat transfer to the wall . the external mach number, the length-to-depth ratio of the cavity, the ratio of the oncoming boundary layer thickness to the notch depth (in the turbulent flow region), the thermal to-momentum thickness ratio of the boundary layer and, finally, the geometry of the internal boundary of the separated region are varied as systematically as possible .  on the basis of these observations, a simple model of the flow in and the heat transfer across the separated region is formulated ."

"analysis of low-aspect-ratio aircraft structures . two methods are presented for the analysis of complex low- aspect-ratio aircraft structures .  both methods provide for arbitrary external loading, are general with respect to the orientation of structural members, and permit arbitrary boundary conditions .  for purposes of analysis a structure is idealized as a network of flexural members with interconnected torsion boxes . in the first method, sets of linear equations are obtained by expressing boundary conditions, member deflection equations, equilibrium requirements, and slope-compatibility relationships in terms of deflections and internal forces .  the solution for deflections and internal forces is then formed as the product of an inverse structural matrix and a column matrix of load functions . in the second method, the conditions at a given boundary are assembled as a column matrix and are transferred in a step by-step fashion over the entire structure to an opposite boundary . the transfer is accomplished by successive multiplications of square matrices composed independently for the different transfer ranges .  the final operation is the inversion of a relatively small matrix and provides the solution for the unknown boundary conditions . comparisons of theoretical results with experimental data and electric-analog solutions are favorable ."
"supersonic flow at the surface of a circular cone at angle of attack . formulas for the inviscid flow properties on the surface of a cone at angle of attack are derived for use in conjunction with the m.i.t. cone tables .  these formulas are based upon an entropy distribution on the cone surface which is uniform and equal to that of the shocked fluid in the windward meridian plane .  they predict values for the flow variables which may differ significantly from the corresponding values obtained directly from the cone tables .  the differences in the magnitudes of the flow variables computed by the two methods tend to increase with increasing free-stream mach number, cone angle and angle of attack ."
"temperature and velocity profiles in the compressible laminar boundary layer with arbitrary distribution of surface temperature . an analysis is presented which enables the temperature profiles, veiocity profiles, heat transfer, and skin friction to be calculated for laminar flow over a two-dimensional or axially symmetric surface without pressure gradient but with an arbitrary analytic distribution of surface temperature .  the general theory is applicable to a gas of any prandtl number, although the numerical results given herein have been computed for air . the predictions of the theory for the special case of constant surface temperature are compared with the calculations of crocco . on the basis of this comparison, it is inferred that the present theory enables heat-transfer and skin-friction calculations accurate to within about 5 per cent to be made for flight conditions up to mach numbers near 5 and to within about 1 or 2 per cent for supersonic wind-tunnel conditions up to considerably higher mach numbers . a particular effort has been made to present the results, which are simple considering their generality, in a form that can be used readily in practical applications .  from the mathematical point of view, the theory is applicable to an arbitrary analytic distribution of surface temperature, but in any given practical case it is necessary that the surface-temperature distribution be approximated by a polynomial .  the only unknowns in the final equations developed are the coefficients of this polynomial, so that the work involved in applying the theory in any given case depends entirely on the work involved in approximating a given surface- temperature distribution by a polynomial . an example is worked out in detail which illustrates some of the principal effects of variable surface temperature .  it is shown that both positively infinite and negatively infinite heat-transfer coefficients can occur .  the anomaly of infinite and negative heat-transfer coefficients is discussed and attributed to the customary definition of the heat-transfer coefficient, which is shown to be fundamentally inappropriate for flows with variable surface temperature .  in the particular example considered, a conventional method for calculating the net heat transferred yields completely incorrect results .  a brief qualitative discussion of the possible effects of the heat transfer on flow separation is given . in order to facilitate the use of the results, all of the principal equations developed are collected and summarized in the section entitled /practical use of results ./"

"some effects of joint conductivity on the temperature and thermal stresses in aerodynamically heated skin-stiffener combinations . temperatures and thermal stresses in typical skin-stiffener combinations of winglike structures subjected to aerodynamic heating have been obtained with the aid of an electronic differential analyzer . variations were made in an aerodynamic heat-transfer parameter, in a joint conductivity parameter, and in the ratio of skin width to skin thickness . the results, which are presented in nondimensional form, indicate that decreasing the joint conductivity parameter lowers both the interior and the average temperature ratios, increases the peak thermal stress ratios in the skin, and may considerably increase the peak stiffener stress ratios,. increasing the aerodynamic heat-transfer parameter decreases the interior and average temperature ratios, increases the peak skin stress ratios somewhat, but greatly increases the peak stiffener stress ratios,. and increasing the ratio of skin width to skin thickness produces only moderate decreases in the peak skin stress ratios while moderately increasing the peak stiffener stress ratios ."
"dynamic stability of vehicles traversing ascending or descending paths through the atmosphere . an analysis is given of the oscillatory motions of vehicles which traverse ascending and descending paths through the atmosphere at high speed .  the specific case of a skip path is examined in detail, and this leads to a form of solution for the oscillatory motion which should recur over any trajectory .  the distinguishing feature of this form is the appearance of the bessel rather than the trigonometric function as the characteristic mode of oscillation ."

"predicted shock envelopes about two types of vehicles at large angles of attack . methods based on oblique- and normal-shock relationships and the continuity of mass flow through suitably chosen volume elements between the shock and body were developed to predict shock envelopes about two types of vehicles being considered for atmosphere entry .  one type is a high-drag capsule shape .  the other type is essentially a slender triangular wing capable of providing high lift or high drag, depending on the angle of attack .  predicted and measured shock envelopes were compared for a mach number range of 3 to 15 for vehicles at high angles of attack,. good agreement was found .  most of the available experimental data were in a speed and temperature range in which no important real-gas effects occurred ."
"a study of flow changes associated with airfoil section drag rise at supercritical speeds . a study of experimental pressure distributions and section characteristics for several moderately thick airfoil sections was made .  a correlation appears to exist between the drag-divergence mach number and the free-stream mach number for which sonic velocity occurs at the airfoil crest, the chordwise station at which the airfoil surface is tangent to the free-stream direction .  it was found that, since the mach number for which sonic velocity occurs at the airfoil crest can be estimated satisfactorily by means of the prandtl-glauert rule, a method is provided whereby the drag-divergence mach number of an airfoil section at a given angle of attack can be estimated from the low-speed pressure distribution and the airfoil profile .  this method was used to predict with a reasonable degree of accuracy the drag-divergence mach number of a considerable number of airfoil sections having diverse shapes and a wide range of thickness-chord ratios . the pressure distributions and section force characteristics of several moderately thick airfoil sections at mach numbers above the drag-divergence mach number were analyzed .  some of the characteristics of the flow over these airfoils at supercritical mach numbers are discussed ."

"boundary layer behind shock or thin expansion wave moving into stationary fluid . the boundary layer behind a shock or thin expansion wave advancing into a stationary fluid has been determined .  laminar and turbulent boundary layers were considered .  the wall surface temperature behind the wave was also investigated .  the assumption of a thin expansion wave is valid for weak expansions but becomes progressively less accurate for strong expansion waves . the laminar-boundary-layer problem was solved by numerical integration except for the weak wave case, which can be solved analytically . integral (karman-pohlhausen type) solutions were also obtained to provide a guide for determining expressions which accurately represent the numerical data .  analytical expressions for various boundary-layer parameters are presented which agree with the numerical integrations within 1 percent . the turbulent-boundary-layer problem was solved using integral methods similar to those employed for the solution of turbulent compressible flow over a semi-infinite flat plate . the fluid velocity, relative to the wall, was assumed to have a seventh-power profile .  the blasius equation, relating turbulent skin friction and boundary-layer thickness, was utilized in a form which accounted for compressibility . consideration of the heat transfer to the wall permitted the wall surface temperature, behind the wave, to be determined .  the wall thickness was assumed to be greater than the wall thermal-boundary-layer thickness .  it was found that the wall temperature was uniform (as a function of distance behind the wave) for the laminar-boundary-layer case but varied with distance for the turbulent-boundary-layer case ."
"investigation of the stability of the laminar boundary layer in a compressible fluid . in the present report the stability of two-dimensional laminar flows of a gas is investigated by the method of small perturbations . the chief emphasis is placed on the case of the laminar boundary layer . part 1 of the present report deals with the general mathematical theory .  the general equations governing one normal mode of the small velocity and temperature disturbances are derived and studied in great detail .  it is found that for reynolds numbers of the order of those encountered in most aerodynamic problems, the temperature disturbances have only a negligible effect on those particular velocity solutions which depend primarily on the viscosity coefficient (/viscous solutions/) .  indeed, the latter are actually of the same form in the compressible fluid as in the incompressible fluid, at least to the first approximation .  because of this fact, the mathematical analysis is greatly simplified .  the final equation determining the characteristic values of the stability problem depends on the /inviscid solutions/ and the function of tietjens in a manner very similar to the case of the incompressible fluid .  the second viscosity coefficient and the coefficient of heat conductivity do not enter the problem,. only the ordinary coefficient of viscosity near the solid surface is involved . part 2 deals with the limiting case of infinite reynolds numbers . the study of energy relations is very much emphasized .  it is shown that the disturbance will gain energy from the main flow if the gradient of the product of mean density and mean vorticity near the solid surface has a sign opposite to that near the outer edge of the boundary layer . a general stability criterion has been obtained in terms of the gradient of the product of density and vorticity, analogous to the rayleigh-tollmien criterion for the case of an incompressible fluid . if this gradient vanishes for some value of the velocity ratio of the main flow exceeding 1-1/m (where m is the free stream mach number) ."

"flight measurement of wall pressure fluctuations and boundary-layer turbulence . the results are presented for a flight test program using a fighter type jet aircraft flying at pressure altitudes of 10,000, 20,000, and apparatus was used to measure and record the output of microphones and hot-wire anemometers mounted on the forward-fuselage section and wing of the airplane .  mean-velocity profiles in the boundary layers were obtained from total-pressure measurements . the ratio of the root-mean-square fluctuating wall pressure to the free-stream dynamic pressure is presented as a function of reynolds number and mach number .  the longitudinal component of the turbulent-velocity fluctuations was measured, and the turbulence-intensity profiles are presented for the wing and forward-fuselage section . in general, the results are in agreement with wind-tunnel measurements which have been reported in the literature .  for example, the variation of (is the root mean square of the wall-pressure fluctuation, and q is the free-stream dynamic pressure) with reynolds number was found to be essentially constant for the forward fuselage-section boundary layer, while variations at the wing station were probably unduly affected by the microphone diameter, which was large compared with the boundary-layer thickness ."
"a comparative analysis of the performance of long range hypervelocity vehicles . long-range hypervelocity vehicles are studied in terms of their motion in powered flight, and their motion and aerodynamic heating in unpowered flight .  powered flight is analyzed for an idealized propulsion system which rather closely approaches present-day rocket motors . unpowered flight is characterized by a return to earth along a ballistic, skip, or glide trajectory .  only those trajectories are treated which yield the maximum range for a given velocity at the end of powered flight . aerodynamic heating is treated in a manner similar to that employed previously by the senior authors in studying ballistic missiles (naca tn 4047), with the exception that radiant as well as convective heat transfer is considered in connection with glide and skip vehicles . the ballistic vehicle is found to be the least efficient of the several types studied in the sense that it generally requires the highest velocity at the end of powered flight in order to attain a given range . this disadvantage may be offset, however, by reducing convective heat transfer to the re-entry body through the artifice of increasing pressure drag in relation to friction drag - that is, by using a blunt body .  thus the kinetic energy required by the vehicle at the end of powered flight may be reduced by minimizing the mass of coolant material involved . the glide vehicle developing lift-drag ratios in the neighborhood of and greater than 4 is far superior to the ballistic vehicle in ability to convert velocity into range .  it has the disadvantage of having far more heat convected to it,. however, it has the compensating advantage that this heat can in the main be radiated back to the atmosphere . consequently, the mass of coolant material may be kept relatively low . the skip vehicle developing lift-drag ratios from about 1 to 4 is found to be superior to comparable ballistic and glide vehicles in converting velocity into range .  at lift-drag ratios below 1 it is found to be about equal to comparable ballistic vehicles while at lift-drag ratios"
"an analytical treatment of aircraft propeller precession instability . an analytical investigation is made of a precession-type instability which can occur in a flexibly supported aircraft-engine-propeller combination .  by means of an idealized mathematical model which is comprised of a rigid power-plant system flexibly mounted in pitch and yaw to a fixed backup structure, the conditions required for neutral stability are determined .  the paper also examines the sensitivity of the stability boundaries to changes in such parameters as stiffness, damping, and asymmetries in the engine mount, propeller speed, airspeed, mach number, propeller thrust, and location of pitch and yaw axes .  stability is found to depend strongly on the damping and stiffness in the system . with the use of nondimensional charts theoretical stability boundaries are compared with experimental results obtained in wind-tunnel tests of an aeroelastic airplane model .  in general, the theoretical results, which do not account for wing response, show the same trends as observed experimentally,. however, for a given set of conditions calculated airspeeds for neutral stability are consistently lower than the measured values .  evidently, this result is due to the fact that wing response tends to add damping to the system ."
"effects of extreme surface cooling on boundary layer transition . an investigation was made to determine the combined effects of surface cooling, pressure gradients, nose blunting, and surface finish on boundary-layer transition .  data were obtained for various body shapes at a mach number of 3.12 and reynolds numbers per foot as high as 15x10 . previous transition studies, with moderate cooling, have shown agreement with the predictions of stability theory .  for surface roughnesses ranging from 4 to 1250 microinches the location of transition was unaffected with moderate cooling .  with extreme cooling, an adverse effect was observed for each of the parameters investigated .  in general, the transition reynolds number decreased with decreasing surface temperature . in particular, the beneficial effects of a favorable pressure gradient obtained with moderate cooling disappear with extreme cooling, and a transition reynolds number lower than that observed on a cone is obtained . further, an increase in the nose bluntness decreased the transition reynolds number under conditions of extreme cooling ."
"effect of distributed three-dimensional roughness and surface cooling on boundary layer transition and lateral spread of turbulence at supersonic speeds . an investigation was made in the langley 4 by 4-foot supersonic pressure tunnel at mach numbers of 1.61 and 2.01 to determine (1) the effect of distributed roughness on boundary-layer transition with the model surface at adiabatic wall temperature and cooled and (2) the effect of surface cooling on the lateral spread of turbulence .  both distributed granular-type and single spherical roughness particles were used, and transition of the boundary layer was determined by hot-wire anemometers .  the transition-triggering mechanism of the three-dimensional roughness at supersonic speeds appeared to be the same as that previously observed at subsonic speeds .  in fact, the critical value of the roughness reynolds number parameter (that is, the value at which turbulent spots are initiated by the roughness) was found to be approximately the same at supersonic and subsonic speeds when complete local conditions at the top of the roughness, including density and viscosity, were considered in the formulation of the roughness reynolds number .  for three-dimensional roughness at a reynolds number less than its critical value, the roughness introduced no disturbances of sufficient magnitude to influence transition .  surface cooling, although providing a theoretical increase in stability to small disturbances, did not increase to any important extent the value of the critical roughness reynolds number for three-dimensional roughness particles .  cooling, therefore, because of its effect on the boundary-layer thickness, density, and viscosity actually promoted transition due to existing three-dimensional surface roughness for given mach and reynolds numbers .  the measured lateral spread of turbulence in the boundary layer appeared to be unaffected by the increased laminar stability derived from the surface cooling ."
"compressible laminar flow and heat transfer about a rotating isothermal disk . the flow and heat transfer about a rotating isothermal disk are re-examined to include the effects of compressibility and property variations .  if viscous dissipation is neglected, the compressible problem is correlated to the incompressible problem by assuming linear variations of viscosity and thermal conductivity with temperature .  certain inaccuracies in several previous incompressible solutions are noted and corrected herein .  the effect of compressibility appears as a distortion of the normal coordinate and normal velocity component and as a multiplicative factor in the heat-transfer coefficient, the nusselt number, and in the expressions for the skin-friction components and torque required to rotate the disk ."
"theoretical investigation of the ablation of a glass-type heat protection shield of varied material properties at the stagnation point of a re-entering irbm . the melting-type heat protection at the stagnation point of a re-entering irbm is treated by employing homogeneous, opaque, and nondecomposing glass shields which do not exceed a temperature of some effects due to variations of the glass properties .  the ballistic re-entry vehicle has a nose diameter of 0.635 m, a ballistic factor of 3.5 x 10, a re-entry angle of 124.9 (from the vertical) at an altitude of 100 km, and a re-entry speed of 4.5 . the performance of 36 different glass shields with assumed combinations of material properties is investigated by employing a calculation method which yields practically exact, transient solutions for the problem .  as a corollary, results for a certain steady flight state are also given .  the discussions made it possible to derive under realistic flight conditions some thermal characteristics for the employment of thin, or light-weight, glass shields . investigation of these hypothetical glass shields leads to the conclusion that a low thermal conductivity and a high specific heat, and thus, a small thermal diffusivity are most desirable .  a small thermal diffusivity yields high surface temperatures, causing a high radiative heat transfer out of the shield,. and steep temperature profiles normal to the surface, causing a small thermal penetration across the shield with little total ablation of the shield .  results show that for the assumed irbm re-entry, the necessary thickness of the employed glass shields increases monotonically with thermal diffusivity which is the only material parameter affecting this thickness . a high viscosity level and a high emissivity constant of the surface of the supposedly opaque shield are also desirable,. although, these two properties exert a comparatively small influence on the overall performance when disregarding glass shields with an extremely low viscosity level ."
"discussion of solar proton events and manned space flights . as a result of studies made during the international geophysical year (igy) and the international geophysical cooperation (igc), it is known that a considerable fraction of large solar flares give rise to almost pure streams of protons which reach the earth and continue to arrive for as long as 11 days . the energies of these particles lie within a very steep spectrum extending from 20 to least 500 mev .  because of the frequency of large flares during times of high solar activity, and owing to the long duration of each solar proton emission, these particles were present in detectable intensity near the top of the earth's atmosphere for about 15 percent of the time from 1957 to 1960 .  the number of large flares that accelerated and released these particles during this three-year period was about 30 . the event that began on august 22, 1958 contributed greatly toward the understanding of the solar and terrestrial sequence of events, and in addition provided the first identification of the emitted particles .  a flare on may of protons in the neighborhood of the earth that this phenomenon was recognized as an additional radiation hazard to manned vehicles in the high atmosphere and in most parts of the solar system .  the three very intense events that occurred in july, 1959 further supported this conclusion, and the possibility of predicting such events became an important consideration .  in addition to its value in the protection of human beings, effective forecasting clearly would be of great value in the detailed scientific study of this phenomenon . this paper presents a preliminary discussion of some aspects of predicting the arrival of protons at the earth following the appearance of solar activity features and, equally important, of forecasting the periods when this penetrating radiation is unlikely to occur ."

"on trails of axisymmetric hypersonic blunt bodies flying through the atmosphere . the trail left in the atmosphere by a body moving at hypersonic speeds is the subject of theoretical treatment .  the times required for ionization and dissociation (and their inverse processes) to go to completion, when compared to the flow times of a gas particle, are important in determining the observable effects of hypersonic trails-i.e., emitted thermal radiation and reflection of electromagnetic waves from the trail . in order to simplify the theoretical treatment, the trail is divided into two regions ..  (1) the expansion-controlled trail, which treats the behavior of the wake behind the body up to a point, along the direction of flight, where the pressure decays to the free-stream value and cooling is controlled principally by the expansion of the flow, and (2) the conduction-controlled trail, where the trail cools mainly by diffusion of heat away from the high-temperature core . the influence of the details of the body shape on the observables are discussed and a simple computational procedure for the behavior of the conduction-controlled trail is developed based on integral methods .  results of calculations that assume thermodynamic equilibrium of the flow field give the values of the thermodynamic variables in the trail of a sphere, axial distributions of emitted thermal radiation, and maps of electron density distribution .  it is shown that the cooling of the conduction-controlled trail is essentially due to conduction of heat and that viscous effects are not important .  it is found that this portion of the trail does not widen as one proceeds downstream .  flight velocities considered vary between 15,000 and 35,000 ft sec and altitudes range between 100,000 and 250,000 ft ."

"magnetohydrodynamic free-convection pipe flow . it has been shown that transverse magnetic fields of practical strengths exert considerable influence on liquid-metal, free-convection, vertical, flat-plate and parallel-plate flow fields . the extent of influence was determined by the magnitude of a nondimensional parameter a which is the ratio of the hartmann number to the fourth root of the grashof number, and is a measure of the relative influence of the magnetic and buoyant forces .  in this note the steady, fully developed, laminar, free-convection flow of a fluid of electrical conductivity through a fully submerged, open-ended, constant-temperature, vertical pipe located in a transverse magnetic field of strength is analyzed in terms of the same parameter .  the magnitude of its influence on the velocity and temperature profiles, the surface shear and heat transfer, and the volumetric flow rate is determined ."
"an investigation of separated flows, part i: the pressure field . the present article describes an investigation of several types of separated regions such as blunt-base wakes and cavities formed in cutouts in the boundaries and ahead of or behind two dimensional steps in supersonic (mach numbers 2 to 4) and subsonic flow .  the conditions for the existence, the geometry, and the pressure field are described in this paper . a second article (to be published) will describe investigations of the internal flow and the heat transfer across such separated regions . it is found that there is a maximum (critical) ratio of the length of the separated free-shear layer to the depth of the depression in the boundary beyond which the cavity collapses, leaving mutually independent separated regions at each protrusion . this critical length changes greatly upon laminar-turbulent transition in the oncoming boundary layer,. in either laminar or turbulent flow it is approximately independent of mach and reynolds numbers .  a semiempirical correlation predicting the conditions under which the flow will span a depression of arbitrary depth is proposed . detailed pressure distributions along the boundaries of a cavity (in turbulent flow) are presented as a function of the ratio of the cavity length to the critical length, which is found to be the pertinent similarity parameter .  for short notches the impact pressure due to the reversal of the inner portion of the shear layer at recompression tends to thicken the shear layer and a type of boundary layer-free stream interaction governs the pressure field .  the pressure in the cavity is nearly constant and can be higher than free-stream .  in long notches the shear layer bends inward at separation and curves back gradually ahead of the recompression point .  the floor-pressure variation is pronounced and the recovery pressure at reattachment is small .  the variation of the drag coefficient with mach number reflects the change from one to the other mechanism of recompression . detailed surveys of the mach-number distributions in a blunt-body wake and the mixing region behind its throat, as well as in the shear layer spanning a cutout in a wall, are presented and analyzed .  it is found that, in general, the assumptions of the simple supersonic-wake models which rely on a principle of steady flow with mass conservation in the cavity are not adequate for cavities in which there is recompression against a boundary . results showing the influence of the thickness of the initial boundary layer (in the range of 0.3 to 3 times the notch depth) and of the geometry of the notch are also presented ."

"the transverse curvature effect in compressible axially symmetric laminar boundary layer flow . the viscous transverse curvature effect in compressible axially symmetric laminar boundary-layer flow has been investigated, and it is found that the effect is characterized by the parameter which is essentially the ratio of the boundary-layer thickness to body radius .  it is shown that the busemann and crocco integrals of the two-dimensional energy equation for are still valid for axially symmetric flow in which the transverse curvature effects are considered .  by a generalization of mangler's transformation it is then shown that the boundary-layer equations are reducible to an almost two-dimensional form, making the analysis simpler for two asymptotic flow regions characterized by and less than or of the order of unity . it is with the latter region that the present paper is primarily concerned, and for this case it is shown that the additional term in the momentum and energy equations, which differentiates them from the two-dimensional form, behaves like an external favorable pressure gradient . except for certain special cases it is necessary to obtain the of the order of unity by means of asymptotic expansions in ascending powers of a parameter that is small compared to unity but proportional to .  it is shown how the asymptotic solutions can be found for (1) the velocity and temperature distributions for the compressible zero pressure gradient case when the body shapes are given by and and (2) the velocity distribution for incompressible flow with an external velocity of the form past a body given by .  the zeroth approximation is the mangler result .  for the cases of a linear external velocity distribution, similar profiles can be found for all values of .  more generally it is shown that similar profiles exist if the exponents n and m satisfy the condition that . here, similar is used in the restricted meaning that the distributions are derivable from ordinary differential equations . in the case of the cone and cylinder with zero pressure gradient where the equations have been numerically integrated for, the first-order correction to the mangler formulation shows that the effect on both the skin-friction coefficient and heat-transfer rate can become appreciable in the range where is less than or of the order of unity .  at a constant, the effects are increased in magnitude when either the ratio of wall to free-stream temperature, or mach number, is increased .  also, all other conditions being equal, for the same value of the skin-friction coefficient and heat-transfer increase on the cylinder is greater than that on the cone . for flows with pressure gradient, the transverse curvature term behaves again like a favorable pressure gradient and tends to delay both separation and transition when compared with axially symmetric flows in which the transverse curvature effect is neglected ."

"review of published data on the effect of roughness on transition from laminar to turbulent flow . a review is presented of the published data on the effect of roughness, especially single roughness elements, on transition from laminar to turbulent flow, in which an attempt is made to reanalyze and correlate the available information .  the reanalysis shows that the transition reynolds number of a flat plate with zero pressure gradient is a function of the ratio of the height of the roughness element to the displacement thickness of the boundary layer at the element, this functional relation being a better representation of the data than a constant critical reynolds number of the roughness element .  other data show that the effects of roghness are similar in streams of different initial turbulence and that a plot of the ratio of transition reynolds number of the rough plate to that for the smooth plate against the ratio of the height of the roughness element to displacement thickness of the boundary layer at the element gives good correlation of all the data for a given shape when transition occurs downstream from the roughness element .  at a certain value of the height-thickness ratio dependent on the stream speed, location of roughness element, and airstream turbulence, the transition position reaches the element and remains there as the height or the stream speed is further increased . the paper also discusses available data on the effect of distributed roughness on transition on a flat plate, as well as some of the published data on roughness effects on transition on air-foils ."
"a mixing theory for the interaction between dissipative flows and nearly isentropic streams . by means of a simplified theoretical /model,/ the present paper treats the general class of flow problems characterized by the interaction between a viscous or dissipative flow near the surface of a solid body, or in its wake, and an /outer/ nearly isentropic stream .  for the present, the external flow is taken to be a plane, steady, supersonic flow, which makes a small angle with a plane surface or plane of symmetry, although the methods used can be extended to curved surfaces, to axially symmetric supersonic flows, and also to subsonic flows .  the internal dissipative flow is regarded as quasi-one-dimensional and parallel to the surface on the average, with a properly defined mean velocity and mean temperature .  the nonuniformity of the actual velocity distribution is taken into account only approximately by means of a relation between mean temperature and mean velocity . mixing, or the transport of momentum from outer stream to dissipative flow, is considered to be the fundamental physical process determining the pressure rise that can be supported by the flow . with the aid of this concept, a large number of flow problems is shown to be basically similar, such as boundary-layer shockwave interaction, wake flow behind blunt-based bodies (base pressure problem), flow separation in overexpanded supersonic nozzles, separation on wings and bodies, etc ."

"the fundamentals of the statistical theory of turbulence . statistical theory in general considers mean values of certain quantities .  in the case of the turbulent motion one is interested in mean values of velocities and of their derivatives, and in mean values of squares and products of velocities and their derivatives .  it was o. reynolds who first expressed the so-called apparent or turbulent stresses by the mean values of the products of the velocity components .  the different theories suggested so far have as their common objective the establishment of relations between certain mean values, e.g. between the turbulent shear stresses given by the mean products of velocity fluctuations and the derivatives of the mean velocities, i.e. the measured mean velocity gradients .  in this sort of investigations the conception of the /correlation/ is of paramount importance .  the late a. friedman tried to introduce the correlations as unknown variables in the hydrodynamic equations., however, he could not carry his investigations to practical results, i.e., to results which can be compared with the experimental evidence .  recently, g. i. taylor had success in his analysis of /isotropic/ turbulence by means of correlation calculations, and was able to discuss, theoretically, the problem of the decay of turbulence in a windstream behind a turbulence producing device .  his theory raised considerable interest because it is concerned with the important problem of wind-tunnel turbulence and its results could be compared directly with experimental work done by dryden in this country and by fage, townend and simmons in england . the present paper is concerned with two fundamental problems.. with uniform isotropic turbulence and with the turbulent friction in a parallel stream .  first, the general theory of isotropic turbulence is developed .  this general theory includes taylor's consideration as a special case .  however, it"
"vibration isolation of aircraft power plants . vibration in aircraft structure can almost always be traced to vibratory forces originating from the power plant .  these forces are transmitted to the aircraft in two ways ..  (1) by the action of air forces upon the surfaces of the aircraft in, or adjacent to, the slip stream of the propeller, and (2) by direct transmission of unbalanced forces from the power plant through the engine mounting .  the latter has always caused the preponderance of disturbance . vibratory stresses induced in the engine mounting structure occasionally produce fatigue failures in the associated parts, and always shorten the useful life of the entire aircraft structure .  more important, however, are the psychological and physiological effects of continuous vibration and its attendant noise on the passengers and crew .  this may very likely be the major source of the rapid fatigue which is so intimately associated with flying .  the importance and desirability of drastically reducing vibration can hardly be questioned . this paper is limited to a consideration of the directly transmitted forces and, further, considers the power plants as rigid bodies attached by flexible means to the aircraft which is also considered as a rigid body of relatively large mass .  it is also limited to the case of engines and engine supporting structures having axial symmetry (radial engines), although the methods employed could easily be extended to other cases ."
