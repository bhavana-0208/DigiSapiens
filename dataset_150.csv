"The present study is a history of the DEWEY Decimal Classification.  The first edition of the DDC was published in 1876, the eighteenth edition in 1971, and future editions will continue to appear as needed.  In spite of the DDC's long and healthy life, however, its full story has never been told.  There have been biographies of Dewey that briefly describe his system, but this is the first attempt to provide a detailed history of the work that more than any other has spurred the growth of librarianship in this country and abroad."
"This report is an analysis of 6300 acts of use in 104 technical libraries in the United Kingdom. Library use is only one aspect of the wider pattern of information use.  Information transfer in libraries is restricted to the use of documents.  It takes no account of documents used outside the library, still less of information transferred orally from person to person.  The library acts as a channel in only a proportion of the situations in which information is transferred. Taking technical information transfer as a whole, there is no doubt that this proportion is not the major one.  There are users of technical information - particularly in technology rather than science - who visit libraries rarely if at all, relying on desk collections of handbooks, current periodicals and personal contact with their colleagues and with people in other organizations.  Even regular library users also receive information in other ways."
"The relationships between the organization and control of writings and the organization and control of knowledge and information will inevitably enter our story, for writings contain, along with much else, a great deal of mankind's stock of knowledge and information.  Bibliographical control is a form of power, and if knowledge itself is a form of power, as the familiar slogan claims, bibliographical control is in a certain sense power over power, power to obtain the knowledge recorded in written form.  As writings are not simply, and not in any simple way, storehouses of knowledge, we cannot satisfactorily discuss bibliographical control as simply control over the knowledge and information contained in writings."
"The establishment of nine new universities in the 1960's provoked a highly stimulating re-examination of the nature, purpose and management of academic libraries.  Long-established attitudes and methods were questioned, but although changes were made, the basic difficulty remained - a lack of objective information about the best ways of providing a library service in a university. The report of the UGC Committee on Libraries (the Parry Repot [267]), which, in general, endorsed these changes, also stressed the need for research into all aspects of academic library provision."
"Although the use of games in professional education has become widespread only during the last decade, the method has been used in a number of fields for many hundreds of years. Its origins have been traced to simple war games, used in military training when the ""real thing"" was either unavailable or too dangerous.  In more recent times, these games have become more and more sophisticated, and many now use large electronic computers to handle the complex calculations involved. Since 1956, when the first well-developed management game was introduced, the technique has spread rapidly into a wide variety of disciplines and today it is used at all levels of education, from primary school classes to courses for experienced professional men and women.  One of the main causes of this ""game explosion"" has been the rapid development of sophisticated management techniques, such as simulation and mathematical modelling, which have been made possible by rapid advances in computer technology."
"Graduate library school study of abstracting should be more than a how-to-do-it course. It should include general material on the characteristcs and types of abstracts, the historical development of abstracting publications, the abstract-publishing industry (especially in the United States), and the need for standards in the preparation and evaluation of the product. These topics we call concepts. The text includes a methods section containing instructions for writing various types of abstracts, and for editing and preparing abstracting publications. These detailed instructions are supplemented by examples and exercises in the appendix. There is a brief discussion of indexing of abstract publications. Research on automation has been treated extensively in this work, for we believe that the topic deserves greater emphasis than it has received in the past. Computer use is becoming increasingly important in all aspects of librarianship. Much research effort has been expended on the preparation and evaluation of computer-prepared abstracts and extracts. Students, librarians, and abstractors will benefit from knowing about this research and understanding how computer programs were researched to analyze text, select key sentences, and prepare extracts and abstracts. The benefits of this research are discussed. Abstracting is a key segment of the information industry. Opportunities are available for both full-time professionals and part-time or volunteer workers. Many librarians find such activities pleasant and rewarding, for they know they are contributing to the more effective use of stored information. One chapter is devoted to career opportunities for abstractors."
"This book attempts to present representative examples of successful architectural solutions to the important problems librarians and architects face in planning new college and university library buildings or in remodeling and enlarging existing structures.  It does not attempt to make case study evaluations, as was done by Ellsworth Mason for Brown and Yale.  Nor does it present examples of unsuccessful solutions except to show how to avoid mistakes, and in these cases the libraries will not be identified."
"As important for staff members' individual development as was the apprenticeship in administration, perhaps the most significant attitude one acquired while working for Guy was engendered by his insistence that librarians must be interested in and knowledgeable about the content of the materials with which they dealt.  His love of literature, his respect for scholarship, his admiration for good writing and reading were manifested in many ways, but most notably in his admonition that, though we were primarily a research library, we must constantly keep in mind our obligation to collect contemporary poetry, fiction and belles-letters.  It was primarily up to the library staff, he felt, to be responsible for these as well as for ""general"" books which crossed disciplinary lines or fell between the disciplines, those books which a faculty mostly concerned with research materials is apt to overlook.  And in building this portion of the collection, ""there is no substitute for a thorough acquaintance with books through a reading of critical reviews and the books themselves.""  This counsel is from The President, the Professor, and the College Library, but the importance of its thrust--the need to keep up with the world of books and publishing--was continually impressed upon us."
"This study assumed that an additional use study held less promise than an analytical consideration of concepts. The basic approach was a survey comparing traditional and current professional ideas on direct access.  Principal data-gathering instruments were documentary analysis and opinion questionnaire. Findings of the documentary analysis included the following: Research from 1890 to 1970 on the direct shelf approach and browsing left the problems largely unresolved and evidently resistant to established methods of use and user research.  The need for an exhaustive study of concepts was confirmed. Open shelf libraries--organized through shelf classification and relative location--were meant to arouse the intellectual, social, and political interest of the average citizen and affect his democratic self-realization. Definitions of ""browsing"" varied greatly: self-indulgence by the untutored in objectionable works; beneficial self-education for the general reader; valuable guidance for the scholar in his research."
"The purpose of this study was to develop, evaluate, and recommend a national plan  for improving access to periodical resources.  About 48 percent of all academic interlibrary loans are for periodical materials, with the bulk of the loans being satisfied in the form of photocopies.  A major consideration in the long-range improvement of the interlibrary loan system is the possible augmentation with a national system for acquiring, storing, and satisfying loan requests for periodical materials. This study focused on the physical access to the periodical literature.  Based on the needs of the library community, design features were developed, and included the following: Service should be made available to all users without any restriction other than access through a library. Initially, the service should be confined primarily to rapid, dependable delivery of photocopies of journal articles. The collection of a center should be comprehensive in subject coverage excluding only medicine. All worthwhile journals should be collected irrespective of language."
"The scope of acquisitions work, outlined in the Introduction, acknowledges the importance of selection policy, serials recording, and other topics kindred to acquisitions. These topics are discussed in this book only as they relate to obtaining library materials.  They are examined thoroughly in books and papers that are cited in the references and the bibliographic note. Centralized acquisitions and automation of order routines are of major importance in order work and they are reviewed as chapters in this book.  These chapters are introductions to the concepts and problems of centralization and automation, not manuals of practice. For treatment of these topics in particular and in depth the reader is referred to the references cited.  For automation these references are only a modest selection from an enormous literature."
"The Ligue des bibliotheques europeennes de recherche (LIBER) was set up in 1971 as an international non-governmental organization, with the aim of establishing close collaboration between the general research libraries of Western Europe, particularly national and university libraries, and in particular to help in finding practical ways of improving the quality of the services these libraries provide. At the second meeting of its General Assembly, held in Luxembourg in 1972, LIBER decided to hold a seminar on the acquisition of materials from the 'Third World'; and I was charged with the 'intellectual organization' of this seminar.  The purpose of the meeting would be to examine the problems of acquisition; the availability of materials in European libraries both for reference and for lending; and the feasibility of setting up a European centre for the collection of such material, to be available for loan.  The provision of bibliographic information, preferable in machine-readable form, was to be a basic consideration, whatever means were proposed for acquiring publications from those areas.  The Council of Europe made a generous grant towards the cost of the seminar which was held at the University of Sussex from 17 to 19 September 1973."
"I am not, nor have I ever pretended to be, an expert on microfiche.  Nevertheless, when I was invited to address the Third Annual Northeastern DDC/Industry Users Conference in Waltham, Massachusetts in April of 1968 I had the temerity to attempt to describe what I as a user would like to have in a fiche reader.  (""Towards a Uniform Federal Report Numbering System and a Cuddly Microfiche Reader--Two Modest Proposals."" Revised September 1968.  AD-669204)"
"If this book has a central thesis, it rests upon the simple but frequently neglected principle that college library service goes beyond the commonly accepted functions of book circulation and storage.  The college library exists, not merely to house and circulate library materials, but to supplement and extend the teaching process with reference service, to afford faculty members library opportunities for improving instruction, and to encourage students to read more and better books.  Administration is essentially a service activity, a tool through which library functions are more fully and efficiently realized. The present work retains most of the material of the first edition, but includes substantial revision in each chapter.  The book was planned not only as a text in the teaching of college library administration but also for independent professional reading.  Because readers have found the footnotes and chapter bibliographies useful for reference purposes, they have been brought up to date and in some cases extended."
"Technical communication patterns in two research and development laboratories were examined using modified sociometric techniques.. The structure of technical communication networks in the two laboratories results from the interaction of both social relations and work structure.. The sociometric ""stars"" in the technical communication network who provide other members of the organization with information either make greater use of individuals outside the organization or read the literature more than other members of the laboratory.."
"This manual is designed to make it possible for any library to change efficiently to the Library of Congress Classification system.  Detailed procedures are outlined which may serve as exact models or as a series of suggested steps which have proven effective in actual use.  Most of the text deals with the necessary criteria for effecting the planning, making the preparations, selecting the tools, and establishing the procedures which are essential for a reclassification project.  Beyond this, considerable attention has been given to many of the problem areas of the LC Classification-series, biography, bibliography, law, PZ3 and PZ4.  In addition, the literature Tables VIIIa and IXa, two of the most frequently used tables throughout the entire class system, have been thoroughly explained and their application illustrated by a series of comprehensive examples.  Since the mechanics, production, and cost of catalogue card copy can significantly affect the flow of books to users, a chapter has been devoted to describing the use of Xerox copying machines in library operations.  Finally, an annotated bibliography of books and articles judged to be helpful in deciding to reclassify is included for those readers who wish to delve more deeply into the tortuous and frustrating 50-year history of the concept of centralized cataloging and classification.  The numbers enclosed in parentheses throughout the text refer to sources in the bibliography which relate to or support the arguments being advanced in any particular case."
"There has long been a need for a continuing series to provide scholarly reviews of the rapidly changing and advancing field of librarianship, a series which would select subjects with particular current significance to the profession and provide an analysis of the advances made through research and practice.  Advances in Librarianship is planned and designed to fill this need.  It will present critical articles and surveys based on the published literature, research in progress, and developments in libraries of all types. Mechanization may appear to be the most obvious of the advancing fronts of librarianship, for automation has caught the enthusiastic support of all librarians who can visualize its potential. Advances in this field will certainly be found in every volume of this series. As the first group of articles in this volume demonstrate, technological change has an obvious and direct implication for libraries, but the problem has been found to be much more complex than the simple inventory problem many experts expected. Advances in Librarianship is dedicated to presenting the realities of automation, assessing where we are, where we are going, and how fast we can hope to get there. ""The Machine and Cataloging"" reviews the current status of the machine-produced book catalog and what lies ahead as we enter the age of MARC. Where business methods have greater applicability, progress is easier, as reported in ""Mechanization of Acquisition Processes."" Even in this area generally acceptable practices and standardization are in the future, not the past. One of the problems of major and immediate importance in computerization of catalog information is that discussed in ""Filing Systems for Computer Manipulation."" This detailed review presents the complexity of the problems and suggests possible solutions. For many years technical service costs have been defended without adequate knowledge of the facts. As automated procedures are proposed, standards are determining costs of traditional operations become essential. The article on standards for such costs shows why the problems have been difficult and reviews the significant advances of the past few years. The school library has widened its dimensions in materials and services much more rapidly than other libraries, as reflected in its new name, the instructional media center. Here, technical change, together with new teaching methods, has made possible major developments in library service in schools as well as for children in the public library. Two articles make clear that what can be done has been demonstrated, and that what remains is to make this the rule rather than the exception. Bibliotherapy is an example of a field in which progress has been slow. Articles which illustrate the potential which systems theory and managerial planning theory have for libraries. The articles on the application of these concepts, which come from research in administration, are provocative and may appear controversial to some. The article on library development in developing countries provides an analysis in depth of our efforts and degree of success in assisting other countries in providing the library service which is so important in the modern world."
"The present contribution does not duplicate previous studies but complements the earlier publications and closes the few gaps that exist in the literature prior to 1966 and after 1971.  Additionally, it is a bold attempt to evaluate critically and objectively the history of the mechanized selective dissemination of information (SDI) as reflected in the literature, from the initial description by Luhn (1958, 1961b, c) to the post-1970 period when the SDI boom began losing ground to the more popular on-line interactive systems.  The review therefore questions and interprets the concept of SDI, its implementation, and its evolution in the light of work performed by many companies, government agencies, universities, societies, and libraries during the last fourteen years."
"In trying to give an account of the statistical properties of language, one is faced with the problem of having to find the common thread which would show the many and multifarious forms of language statistics - embodied in scattered papers written by linguists, philosophers, mathematicians, engineers, each using his own professional idiom as belonging to one great whole: quantitative linguistics. The book stresses the peculiarity of statistics of language structure as against just conventional statistics.  To put the difference between two types of statistics briefly, the latter comprises the methods and parameters of general number statistics as applied, e.g., in Economics and Demography, the former has its own methods and characterising parameters, particularly useful for describing and evaluating language structure.  The idea of statistical linguistics as using concepts and methods of its own, which was adumbrated in the author's ""Language as choice and Chance"", 1956, has now taken definite shape. Of this development I shall try to give a brief account.  In my book, ""Language as Choice and Chance"", the foundation was laid for a truly sensible application of statistics to language by my interpretation of the langue-parole dichotomy as being essentially that between statistical universe and sample."
"Most librarians mark the beginning of modern librarianship from the founding of the American Library Association in 1876 and the appearance on the national library scene of such dynamic and controversial figures as Melvil Dewey and Charles Ammi Cutter. But in doing so, they overlook an extremely significant era in the history of our profession, for the quarter century preceding the 1876 meeting in Philadelphia was one characterized by great advances in the field of American librarianship.  This period of growth was to have considerable influence on the course of library development in America after 1876.  To ignore the third quarter of the nineteenth century is to risk misinterpreting the pivotal post-1876 era, and in this time of reappraisal, it seems particularly appropriate and useful to focus our attention on the years preceding the founding of the American Library Association."
"In this book, Lorenz deals with the evolution of aggression in vertebrates.  He points out that aggressivity is totally different from predation: that it is a biological necessity for defence of territory and for a cornered animal, and that it becomes mixed up with other innate drives, thus leading up towards reduction of intraspecific damage. This, be it noted, is most evident in fiercer social predators like wolves, where escape from the pack is virtually impossible and where co-operation without fighting is necessary for survival; whereas in the non-social but proverbially peaceful dove prevention of escape leads to violent and often fatal attacks on the weaker mate. In a final chapter he advances some suggestion as to how in the human species, where evolution is primarily cultural, and not guided by Darwinian selection in the strict sense, the aggressive drive may be canalized into less dangerous channels. Man has innumerable ways of adaptively ritualizing his behavior, many of them analogous, if not homologous, to those found in animals.  In any event, On Aggression is a fascinating book by a master of his subject."
"This paper is not an official policy statement of the American Library Association nor of the Office for Library Education.  It is simply an exploration, an outline of possibilities for consideration by the profession.  Its purpose is to generate discussion that will lead eventually to a statement of Association policy that the profession will support and make effective. A basic assumption on which the statement rests is this: that the library occupation is much broader than that segment of it which is the library profession, but that the professional segment has responsibility for the definition and supervision of the training and education required by the complete range of activities encompassed by the occupation.  Librarians are not the only persons who work in libraries, but librarians are the ones who are concerned with the advancement and improvement of the library profession.  It follows then that it is the obligation of the professionals to engage actively in the establishment and maintenance of standards and norms governing the preparation of people who work at any level in libraries.  They should define and guide the kinds of preparation most useful at the pre-professional level and not merely the education of those who will hold positions at the level we now call ""professional."""
This project was undertaken because of the high degree of uncertainty among the library staff regarding the extent of the problem of missing books.  The findings of this study gave the Ohio State University libraries concrete evidence as to how many books are missing and indicated the areas in which book losses are the greatest.  These figures also provide information which can be conveyed to the faculty or administration when they voice complaints about the unavailability of library books.  The areas where losses are high also tend to indicate the areas of most frequent use.
"1.  What do we mean by technology and what kind of technological forces are we concerned with? 2.  Why is it important to be concerned with technology in thinking about the future of libraries? 3.  What kinds of technology are particularly important for libraries? 4.  How can this technology be applied today? 5.  What can we foresee for the future, as we move toward the year 2000? 6.  What, if anything, should we do tomorrow to try to get from here to here?"
"As far back as the 1920's, algebra had been accepted as the science studying the properties of sets on which there is defined a particular system of operations.  However up until the forties the overwhelming majority of algebraists were investigating merely a few kinds of algebraic structures.  These were primarily groups, rings and lattices.  The first general theoretical work dealing with arbitrary sets with arbitrary operations is due to G. Birkhoff (1935).  During these same years, A. Tarski published an important paper in which he formulated the basic principles of a theory of sets equipped with a system of relations.  Such sets are now called models.  In contrast to algebra, model theory made abundant use of the apparatus of mathematical logic.  The possibility of making fruitful use of logic not only to study universal algebras but also the more classical parts of algebra such as group theory was discovered by the author in 1936. During the next twenty-five years, it gradually became clear that the theory of universal algebras and model theory are very intimately related despite a certain difference in the nature of their problems.  And it is therefore meaningful to speak of a single theory of algebraic systems dealing with sets on which there is defined a series of operations and relations (algebraic systems). The formal apparatus of the theory is the language of the so-called applied predicate calculus.  Thus the theory can be considered to border on logic and algebra."
"This article discusses the possibility of exploiting the statistics of word co-occurrence in text for purposes of document retrieval. Co-occurrence is defined and related to the mental processes of authors and readers; several means of quantitative measurement of word co-occurrence are then scrutinized.  It is shown that the most strongly co-occurring word pairs, which are therefore ""associated"" in a statistical sense, can be represented in the form of an ""association map.""  The last half of the article presents two modes of use of association maps in literature searching."
"A computer program has been written and used which simulates the several-year operation of an information system and computes estimates of the expected operating costs as well as the amount of equipment and personnel required during that time period.  The program has been used for the analysis of several large systems and has proven itself to be a useful research tool for the study of systems with so many components and interrelated operations that an equivalent manual analysis would be extremely cumbersome and time consuming,and perhaps even impractical. This paper describes this program and shows, as an example, some of the results of a simulation of two of several suggested designs for a specific information system."
"Recently a number of articles, books, and reports dealing with information systems, i.e., document retrieval systems, have advanced the doctrine that such systems are to be evaluated in terms of the degree or percentage of relevancy they provide. Although there seems to be little agreement on what relevance means, and some doubt that it is quantifiable, there is, nevertheless, a growing agreement that a fixed and formal relationship exists between the relevance and the recall performance of any system.  Thus, we will find in the literature both a frankly subjective notion of relevance as reported by individual users, and equations, curves, and mathematical formulations which presumably provide numerical measures of the recall and relevance characteristics of information systems.  This phenomenon of shifting back and forth from an admittedly subjective and non-mathematical term to equations in which the same term is given a mathematical value or a mathematical definition has its ancient parallel in discussions of probability.  One cannot, of course, legislate the meaning of a term.  It all depends, as Alice pointed out, on ""who is master,"" the user or the term.  On the other hand, the use of a single term in the same document to cover two or more distinct meanings, especially when such a usage is designed to secure the acceptance of a doctrine by attributing to it mathematical validity which it does not have, represents a more serious situation than merely careless ambiguity."
"The expression ""satisfying a requester's information need"" is often used, but its meaning is obscure.  The literature on ""information need"" in relation to retrieval suggests three different (though not inconsistent) possible interpretations.  However, each of these interpretations is itself fundamentally unclear. The various obscurities involved are indicated by critical questions, which those who write of information need are invited to answer."
"The rationale is given for creation and maintainance by an information center of a controlled indexing and retrieval vocabulary.. Basic vocabulary principles are (1) use of natural language, (2) development of hospitality to new concepts, (3) provision of adequate cross-referencing, and (4) formatting for easy use.. Terminalogical conventions necessary for development and control of a useful vocabulary are summarized, and the techniques for applying these conventions to construct a thesaurus are described.. Computerized editing techniques and updating techniques are briefly set forth.."
"This is an interim report on continuing studies of library operations at Massachusetts Institute of Technology being made by members of the Institute's Operations Research Project in cooperation with the librarians and library staff.  In this report, which is based on actual observations of on-the-premise use made of the Science Library, various statistics measuring the kind, degree, and intensity of use are tabulated.  In addition there are some suggested measures of effectiveness of the library. A unique outcome of the survey has been the construction and verification of a mathematical model employing probability theory to measure rate and kind of use of library material together with length of stay of library patrons. Such models, characteristic of an operations research approach, give promise of furthering the goal of effective library management and planning."
"A comparison of creative and ""noncreative"" research chemists with respect to the ways in which they use their professional and technical literature.. The creative chemists differ from the ""noncreative"" in that the former read more technical literature on the job, are less reluctant to use literature of greater reading difficulty, are less influenced in their independence of thought, read more extensively and consult more frequently the older material, are more inquisitive and have broader cultural interests.. The findings of the study are believed to be helpful in planning library and information services, in refining future inquiries into the ways in which scientists use recorded information, and in improving tests for the identification of creative ability among chemists.."
A consideration of the analogy between the half-life of radioactive substances and the rate of obsolescence of scientific literature.. The validity of this analogy suggest the possibility of more accurate prognostications concerning the period of time during which scientific literature may by used and hence might help to guide the planning of library collections and technical information services..
A distinction is made between bibliographical indexes for new and past literature based on the willingness of the user to trade perfection for currency.. Indexes giving keywords in their context are proposed as suitable for disseminating new information.. These can be entirely machine-generated and hence kept up-to-date with the current literature.. A compatible coding scheme to identify the indexed documents is also proposed.. In it elements are automatically extracted from the usual identifiers of the document so that the coded identifier yields a maximum of information while remaining susceptible to normal methods of ordering..
"An experiment was conducted to determine which of four types of lexical indicators of content could be utilized best by subjects to determine relevant from irrelevant documents and to answer a set of 100 questions.  The results indicate that there were no major differences between the groups using complete text and abstracts to select relevant documents, but the group utilizing the complete text obtained a significantly higher score on the examination."
"Explores the amount of use of books by categories of borrowers in the Yale Medical Library, with a view to discovering the proportion of the catalogue which should be put in machinable form."
"A quantitative estimate is made of the magnitude of the world's scientific and technical journal literature problem. Using a number of basic sources of statistical information, a composite picture is established to show such things as the total volume, linguistic and national origins, breakdown by subject field, and degree of coverage by the abstracting and indexing services."
"A study of several thousand entries in a classified bibliography of article titles (the Index Medicus) revealed that a large proportion of the title entries contained words identical to or synonymous with words of the corresponding subject heading.  It is inferred that a major part of the bibliography studied could have been compiled by a machine procedure operating on titles alone, provided the machine was supplied with a suitable synonym dictionary."
This report describes the results of automatic processing of a large number of scientific papers according to a rigorously defined criterion of coupling.  The population of papers under study was ordered into groups that satisfy the stated criterion of interrelation. An examination of the papers that constitute the groups shows a high degree of logical correlation.
"Results of the census of the world's scientific and technical serial literature, within the limits defined and based on an examination of published source material from countries throughout the world, reflect a total title population much lower than estimated before.. Distribution of this population by country, showing better than 50% of the total divided among six major countries,  is included and discussed, together with a broad subject distribution of serials for certain countries.."
"More than one million citations from the scientific literature have been processed by the Citation Index Project at the Institute for Scientific Information.. The Project, sponsored by NSF and NIH, will be described briefly, and new methods of using citation data for evaluation of publications will be discussed.. Summaries of statistical data, compiled by computer methods such as the following, will be given.. 1. Frequency of citation of one journal by another.. 2. Frequency of current citations to the past literature.. 3. Frequency of self-citation by journals and authors.. 4. Number of source citations per cited paper.. 5. Number of references per source paper.. 6. Number of papers published per journal.."
"Analysis of the problems of defining the mutual relevancies of queries and document-collections indicates that they essentially involve the problem of conceptual relatedness.. In order to consider the later problem, the question of concept-formation is first discussed, which in turn requires a definition of concept.. An extensional interpretation is suggested whereby a concept is associated with a class of conceptually-similar documents.. Users' similarity- judgments then provide the empirical data for formal definitions of concept and conceptual relatedness.. It is found, however, that certain very general difficulties rule out the possibility of defining concepts and their relatedness by the method proposed.. Since this method is based on human relevance-judgments, it seems a natural one to adopt, so that its collapse has serious practical and theoretical consequences.. An alternative approach is therefore proposed whose elaboration will form Part II of this article.."
"A comparison of the ability of humans to consistently judge the relevance of documents to their general interests from bases of citations, abstracts, keywords, and total text was made under controlled experimental conditions.. The results showed that 1) humans are able to make such judgments consistently, and 2) the consistency of the judgment is independent of the particular base from which it is made.. Apparent inconsistency arising from judgments made on the basis of abstracts remains unexplained.. This experiment, as well as others concerned with human evaluations of text material, leave unexplored the basic problem of providing a metric scale on which such evaluations can be measured.."
"A semi-empirical correlation, based on data from nine indexes, permits the prediction of the percentage of terms in a manipulative index vocabulary which will be used to index any given number of documents.. This is a function of the total number of index entries in the system.. A log-normal relationship, similar  to Zipf's Law, exists between total index entries and distribution of term usage.. Based upon the correlation, optimum vocabulary size and growth rate can inferred, as well as the most efficient arrangement of index entries in a storage medium.. The results agree well with published data and appear to be particularly useful for designers of mechanized retrieval or publication operations.."
"Procedures for measuring the consistency of document classification are described.. Three subject specialists classified 997 abstracts of psychological reports into one of eleven categories.. These abstracts were also mechanically classified by a computer program using a factor score computational procedure.. Each abstract was scored for all categories and assigned to the one with the highest score.. The three manual classifications were compared with each other and with the mechanical classifications, and a series of contingency coefficients was computed.. The average reliability of manual classification procedures was equal to .870.. The correlation between automatic and manual classification was .766.."
"The strategy outlined in this article describes a possible aid to the librarian for thinning a library's stack according to the criterion of user needs.. The method uses the last circulation date as a parameter of user circulation requirements.. The resulting stack collection would, by design, satisfy over 99 percent of the user circulation requirements and yet be of minimum size.. Preliminary, but not yet fully validated research, indicates that the number of volumes in a library's holdings may be reduced by 60 to 70 percent and yet satisfy well over 99 percent of the user requirements.. It may also be possible to determine which books should have multiple copies in order that user disappointment can be minimized.. The effective result of this approach is that there now may be a quantitative method of maintaining the library's holdings at a reasonable level and, in addition, a reduction in the disappointment of the user who is unable to find the book he wants because of use by another.."
"Citation indexes to large bodies of science literature can often list far more citing references under the known cited reference than the user can afford the time to look up.. By providing some additional information, beyond the minimal association of the citing reference with the cited reference, a citation index could provide the means of the user to select from a long list those citing references which are most relevant to his immediate search requirement.. Means of providing this selectivity are discussed.. Particular attention is given to the possibility of adding short codes to the citation entries which would be informative of the way in which the citing publication is operationally related to the cited one (this method is an integral feature of the Shepard's legal citations).. A scheme of citation relationships of potential value to users of science literature is presented.. These relationships were tested on a sampling of physics literature.. The suggested categories include indicators of the relation of the citing reference to the scientific process in general, as well as indicators of its relationship to the cited reference in particular.. Assignment of the categories to a citation requires the exercise of judgment, as in subject indexing, but does not involve the use of subject terminology.. An illustration is provided of the application from a citation index to physics literature.."
"The publication explosion has focused renewed attention on the lowly footnote.. While we are all at least partially aware of the technical functions of the citation for both the writer and the reader of the scientific paper, little is known about the norms operating in actual practice.. Even less is known about the operating norms with respect to the more sociological functions, including the acknowledgement of intellectual debts or the conferral of recognition upon the works of others..

"Computer dissemination of information offers significant advantages over manual dissemination because the computer can use strategies that are impractical and in some cases impossible for a human.. This paper describes the Ames Laboratory Selective Dissemination of Information system with emphasis on the effectiveness of user feedback.. The system will accept any document, abstract, keyword, etc., in a KWIC or Science Citation Index Source format.. User profiles consist of words or word clusters each with an initially assigned significance value.. These values are used in making the decision to notify a user that he may be interested in a particular document.. According to responses, the significance values are increased or decreased and quickly attain an equilibrium which accurately describes the user's interests.. The system is economical compared to other existing SDI systems and human intervention is negligible except for adding and deleting profile entries.."
A detailed comparison of how 334 papers in Volume 112 of Physical Review form related groups according to two criteria of relatedness.. The criteria are: (1) the Analytic Subject Index as used by the editors of the Physical Review; and (2) the method of Bibliographic Coupling.. The similarities and differences between the groups thus formed are illustrated and discussed..
correlation between maternal and fetal plasma levels of glucose and free fatty acids . correlation coefficients have been determined between the levels of glucose and ffa in maternal and fetal plasma collected at delivery . significant correlations were obtained between the maternal and fetal glucose levels and the maternal and fetal ffa levels . from the size of the correlation coefficients and the slopes of regression lines it appears that the fetal plasma glucose level at delivery is very strongly dependent upon the maternal level whereas the fetal ffa level at delivery is only slightly dependent upon the maternal level .
"changes of the nucleic acid and phospholipid levels of the livers in the course of fetal and postnatal development . we have followed the evolution of dna, rna and pl in the livers of rat foeti removed between the fifteenth and the twenty-first day of gestation and of young rats newly-born or at weaning . we can observe the following facts.. 1. dna concentration is 1100 ug p on the 15th day, it decreases from the 19th day until it reaches a value of 280 ug 5 days after weaning . 2. rna concentration is 1400 ug p on the 15th day and decreases to 820 during the same period . 3. pl concentration is low on the 15th day and during foetal life (700 ug) and increases abruptly at birth . 4. the ratios rna cyto/dna and pl cyto/dna increase regularly from the 18th day of foetal life . 5. nuclear rna and pl contents are very high throughout the development . 6. these results enable us to characterize three stages in the development of the rat liver.. - from the 15th day to the 18th day of foetal life.. stage of growth through hyperplasia without hypertrophy, - from the 19th day of foetal life to the 3rd day of post-natal life,. stage of cellular reorganisation, - after the 3rd day of post-natal life.. stage of growth through hyperplasia and hypertrophy ."
"surfactant in fetal lamb tracheal fluid . lambs delivered by cesarean section with intact fetal circulation have a fluid filling the trachea . analysis revealed that this fluid contained material high in surface activity in lambs delivered near term, but less surface activity in premature lambs . administration of 10 per cent oxygen to the ewe for 1 hour prior to delivery did not alter the surfactant properties of the fetal tracheal fluid . two analyses of the fetal tracheal fluid revealed it to contain 146 and 198 mg. of lipid per 100 ml., 30 to 40 per cent of which was phospholipid, part of the active component of surfactant . the investigations reported here offer a model for further research into possible intrauterine factors in the pathogenesis of hyaline membrane disease ."
"placental and cord blood lipids.. comparison in a set of double ovum twins, a stillborn and a live-born . 1. determinations of phospholipid, total and free cholesterol, triglyceride and nefa have been made on placental tissue and cord blood in a set of double ovum twins, one stillborn and one live-born . 2. similarities occurred in all fractions studied except the cord blood triglyceride and nefa levels . 3. the serum of the stillborn infant contained one-third as much triglyceride and 21/2 times as much nefa as did the live-born infant . 4. the phospholipid content and the total lipid content of the stillbirth placenta were the highest studied in this laboratory which includes determinations on 26 live births . 5. the suggestion is made that increased lipoprotein lipase activity in the cord blood may accompany intrauterine fetal death ."
"free fatty acid concentration in maternal plasma and fetal body fat content . subcutaneous injection of 200 u.s.p. units of heparin into female sprague-dawley rats produced large and sustained elevations of plasma free fatty acids but no significant change in blood glucose . a group of pregnant rats received such injections of heparin 3 times daily throughout pregnancy . the fetuses from mothers of this group, at 191/2 and 211/2 days of gestation, had significantly more body fat than the fetuses from uninjected mothers . the hypothesis is presented that the maternal free fatty acid concentration in part determines fetal fat accumulation . it is proposed that the body composition changes noted in babies of mothers with diabetes might thus be ascribed to abnormally high maternal plasma free fatty acid concentrations ."
"the concentration of non-esterified fatty acids in maternal and fetal plasma in intact, alloxan-diabetic and x-ray-irradiated rats . determinations of the non-esterified fatty acids in the plasma of pregnant rats showed that there do not exist any increases in the concentrations depending on pregnancy during the period from the 20th - 22nd day of pregnancy . in the fetal plasma the concentrations of non-esterified fatty acids only amounted to 40 - 50 per cent of the maternal values . with alloxan diabetes produced 2 days prior to the test the concentration in the maternal plasma increased three- to fivefold, while at the same time a significant rise was absent in fetal plasma with slightly increased average values . whole-body x-ray exposures (dose.. 400r, dose output.. 40r/min) of non-pregnant female and of pregnant rats beginning on the 17th day of pregnancy did not result in any changes of the concentration of non-esterified fatty acids immediately after irradiation ."
"lipid metabolism in toxemia and normal pregnancy . the amount and fatty acid composition of total lipid extract from serum were examined in normal pregnant women in the first, second, and third trimesters, and early postpartum period, and in patients with mild and severe preeclampsia and with essential hypertension . placentas at term were also examined for total lipid and its fatty acid composition . in the normal women, total serum lipid increased during pregnancy . the rise was less pronounced in those with preeclampsia or hypertension . serum palmitate was mildly but significantly elevated in preeclampsia . total lipid and arachidonic acid were elevated in the placentas of preeclamptic women . the findings are compared with those obtained from animals developing eclampsia on an experimental basis ."
"essential fatty acids and acids with trans-configuration in the subcutaneous and visceral fat of the newborn . we made an investigation of the subcutaneous and visceral fat in the newborn . we estimated the contents of linolic and linolenic acid and of acids with trans-configuration spectrophotometrically . we were able to show the penetration of these acids through the placental barrier . the essential fatty acid contents of fat in the newborn is low . in immature ones about 7-14 g, there is a rising trend."
"acetoacetate formation by livers from human fetuses aged 8-17 weeks . slices and homogenates from livers of human fetuses aged 8-17 weeks have a low rate of acetoacetate formation which can be raised by addition of acetate or octanoate to the incubation medium . it was not possible to demonstrate acetoacetate formation by isolated liver mitochondria from 17-week-old fetuses, probably because mitochondria are injured during isolation ."
"changes in blood glucose and non-esterified fatty acids in the foetal and newborn lamb after injection of adrenaline . changes in blood glucose and non-esterified fatty acids after intravenous adrenaline were measured in foetal, newborn and adult sheep in the foetus and immediately after birth there was very little increase in either blood glucose or non-esterified fatty acids after adrenaline . the response of blood glucose to adrenaline had reached adult levels at twenty-four hours of age . the response of non-esterifi- ed fatty acids to adrenaline increased gradually over the first week ."
"electron-microscopic observatations on transference of fat through the human placenta . from the results of our previous and present studied on the transportation of fat through the human placenta by means of electron microscopy, we obtained the following conclusions . 1) neutral fat can permeate through the human placenta without dissociation . 2) almost all processes of fat permeation seem to be due to the biological activity . pinocytosis is most representative, but the authors newly found several facts such as dissolution-like change in the basement membrane and transport via the stroma cell . the authors believe that these results will bring a clue to explain the mechanism of biological transportation of materials through the placenta ."
"the content of phosphatides, triglycerides and cholesterol in placentas, maternal, fetal and new-born liver of the white rat . thin-layer-chromatographic examinations in the maternal rat liver showed different rise of the triglycerides and a significant increase of the esterified cholesterol, however, no striking changes in the content of free cholesterol and lipid phosphorus with the fractions examined (lecithin, colamine cephalin, sphingomyelin and lysolecithin) . as compared to the liver of adult rats, the fetal liver contains a little less than 50 per cent lipid phosphorus . the difference is conditioned by the concentrations of lecithin, and colamine cephalin . on the 19th day the content of triglycerides is lower than in the mother rat . referred to the dry weight, there results a decrease of all phosphatide fractions, as well as of the free cholesterol and a slight rise of the triglycerides from the 19th to the 22nd day . the rise of the phosphatide concentrations to the values of adult rats occurs immediately after birth under the influence of milk food, which, moreover, leads to a considerable increase of the triglyceride values . phospholipid- and triglyceride concentrations of the placenta correspond to those of the fetal liver . solely the content of free cholesterol is higher at the end of pregnancy . the content of triglyceride drops towards the 22nd day ."
"analysis of mammalian lens proteins by electrophoresis . lens proteins of different mammalian species were analyzed by two-dimensional starch gel electrophoresis . the number of fractions detected by this means varied from 11-20 . a-crystallin was resolved into two to three components, b-crystallin into 5-11, and y-crystallin into three to five components . this technique provides a sensitive method for the fractionation of lens proteins and for analyzing species differences ."
"an autoradiographic study on cell migration in the eye lens epithelium from normal and alloxan diabetic rats . lenses from normal and alloxan diabetic rats with and without cataract were investigated by autoradiography 4 hours, 4 days and 8 days after an intraperitoneal injection of h3-thymidine (0.4 uc/g body weight) . the rats were made diabetic 8 days prior to the injection of thymidine at an age of 4 weeks . the position of labelled nuclei of the lens epithelium was noted and their grain numbers counted . the diabetic rats had a lower frequency of labelled nuclei than the controls but after 4 hours their grain counts were equal . frequency diagrams of labelled nuclei are given for each of the three experimental periods . a predominant peak appears after 4 hours at a distance of 30-60 cells in front of the beginning of the nuclear arc . a successive shift towards this area was observed for the longer experimental periods . the shift of the peaks was more restricted in the diabetic animals . this result may best be interpreted as an effect of an increased time of cell generation . as an appendix a histotechnique for the eye lens is given in collaboration with mrs. gertraude moewis ."
"lens development.. the differentiation of embryonic chick lens epithelial cells in vitro and in vivo . the behavior of lens epithelial cells from six-day chick embryos was studied in three different experimental situations.. (a) explantation into several different fluid culture media, (b) explantation followed by reimplantation into lensectomized embryonic eyes, and (c) explantation followed by reimplantation into the embryonic coelomic cavity . specimens were examined histologically, and the total volume of the lens material of each specimen was determined from the planimetry of serial sections . the results were interpreted as follows.. 1. with a small amount of protein supplement in the culture medium, embryonic lens epithelial cells are capable of a limited amount of independent cytodifferentiation . without protein supplement they fail to undergo any fiber formation . 2. when returned to the eye environment, cultured epithelial explants will respond with a resumption of growth, with further cellular differentiation, and with at least some of the morphogenetic changes necessary to form a lens . the embryonic coelom will not support these responses . 3. the initiation of the formation of lens fibers is not sufficient for their complete autonomous maturation . 4. the internal architecture of the developing lens is not the only determinant of its overall shape ."
"treatment of active chronic hepatitis and lupoid hepatitis with 6-mercaptopurine and azothioprine . 6-mercaptopurine or azothioprine ('imuran') was used successfully in 3 patients with active chronic hepatitis and 2 with lupoid hepatitis, for periods up to 1 year . these drugs allowed modification and even abolition of discomforting corticosteroid regimes . their action in chronic hepatitis may be analogous to their anti-immune action in suppressing homograft rejection ."
"treatment of collagen diseases with cytostatics . 22 patients with collagen diseases and 3 patients with other immunological diseases were treated with the cytostatic antimetabolites ('purinethol') 6-mercaptopurine and ('imuran') azathioprine for an average period of four months (range one to eleven months) . improvement was obtained in 17 patients,. and, in 20 out of 22 patients who had been on long-term glucocorticoid medication, the steroid therapy could be permanently discontinued . serious complications occurred, in the form of two deaths from pancytopenia and sepsis . the treatment requires careful supervision of the patients, and should only be instituted, on strict indications, when the alternative is long-term glucocorticoid medication ."
bilateral popliteal cysts in a patient with rheumatoid arthritis . a case of bilateral popliteal cysts and multiple joint subluxations in a patient with rheumatoid arthritis on corticosteroid medication for many years is reported . the effect of long-term corticosteroid therapy on all periarticular connective tissue structure and the relationship of articular disease and popliteal knee cysts to this therapy have been discussed .
"systemic lupus erythematosus and renal transplantation.. report of two cases . two cases of systemic lupus erythematosus along with terminal uremia secondary to lupus nephritis are presented . both patients were treated with renal hemodialysis and transplantation . certain mechanical, infectious, and immunologic problems were responsible for their death . there was no evidence of resurgence of lupus erythematosus in either patient, and the transplanted kidneys did not show evidence of lupus nephritis . renal transplantation should be considered as a last resort in treatment of patients with terminal lupus nephritis ."
arteritis and localised periosteal new bone formation . 1. three patients with localised periosteal new bone formation associated with periosteal arteritis and other evidence of systemic lupus erythematosus are described . 2. systemic steroid therapy was valuable in the management of this condition .
fine structure of subtilis phage sp-50 . some structural details and anomalous forms of subtilis phage sp-50 are described .
"genetic transcription during morphogenesis . messenger rna's from bacillus subtilis undergoing sporulation, germination, or step-down transition have been characterized and compared . hybrid competition experiments indicate that these messengers are derived from distinct genetic loci . the results are consistent with the hypothesis that differential transcription of the genome occurs during morphogenesis . the data also complement previously observed changes in morphology and enzymatic activity in sporulating bacteria ."
"renal amyloidosis a clinicopathological study . the clinical and histopathological data from 40 cases of renal amyloidosis diagnosed by percutaneous renal biopsy are presented . twenty-two cases were labelled as 'secondary' amyloidosis, as definite aetiological factors responsible for renal amyloidosis could be discovered . the predisposing disease states leading to amyloid deposits in the kidney in the order of frequency were fibrocaseous pulmonary tuberculosis, bronchiectasis, lung abscess, and ileocaecal tuberculosis five cases were labelled as suspected 'primary' amyloidosis as a definite evidence of the predisposing disease could not be obtained although the skiagram of chest revealed minimal healed foci . no cause could be determined in thirteen cases, which were, therefore, labelled as 'primary' amyloidosis . albuminuria was a constant feature in all the cases and 32 cases presented as nephrotic syndrome . the rest of the cases presented with hypertension or renal failure in addition to albuminuria . the ancillary procedure, viz., congo-red test, gingival and liver biopsies proved to be of limited value in the diagnosis of renal amyloidosis . the importance of percutaneous renal biopsy as a diagnostic tool has been emphasised ."
"idiopathic autoimmune hemolytic anemia and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura associated with diffuse hypergammaglobulinemia, amyloidosis, hypoalbuminemia and plasmacytosis . a case is reported of a sixty-nine year old woman with severe, idiopathic, autoimmune hemolytic anemia which was initially controlled by splenectomy . a relapse associated with the development of severe, autoimmune, thrombocytopenic purpura failed to respond to large doses of prednisone, but was controlled to a variable degree with imuran . associated features included diffuse hypergammaglobulinemia, excessive gamma-u proteins in the urine, idiopathic hypoalbuminemia with a greatly reduced total exchangeable albumin pool, amyloidosis in the spleen and other organs, and diffuse plasmacytosis of the bone marrow, lymph nodes, and thoracic and peritoneal fat . these features and their interrelationships are discussed . there was no deficiency in the synthesis of specific neutralizing antibodies against viruses, indicating that a qualitative immune deficiency did not exist . the frequency of occurrence of thrombocytopenic purpura in such a case is discussed, as is the prognosis . the mechanism of action of antimetabolites in inducing a remission in autoimmune hemolytic anemia, as well as the etiology of the disease, is reviewed ."
"corticosteroid therapy of amyloid nephrotic syndrome . the results of treatment with prolonged adrenal corticosteroids in 26 adults with amyloid nephrotic syndrome are presented . eight subjects were observed in this series, and 18 additional cases were summarized from the literature . twenty-two of the patients were male and four were female . the diagnosis was established by renal biopsy in 19 instances and by autopsy in the others, with 18 patients considered to have primary amyloidosis and 8, secondary amyloidosis . the majority of the subjects died in renal failure with an average survival after onset of the disease of 17.6 months . the renal disease was indistinguishable from that seen in other forms of the nephrotic syndrome, with the possible exceptions of (a) a high incidence of purpuric skin lesions, (b) a low or negligible incidence of hypertension (at times actual hypotension was prominent), and (c) a rapid and inexorable progression of azotemia despite persistence of the clinical and biochemical characteristics of the nephrotic syndrome . amyloidosis was found by percutaneous renal biopsy in 12 per cent of 83 adults with the nephotic syndrome . corticosteroids did not appear to affect the progress of the disease and were neither beneficial nor detrimental . in view of the high incidence of deleterious side effects of prolonged corticosteroid therapy and the availability of potent diuretic agents which may be helpful in relieving edema in this disorder, it is felt that corticosteroids are contraindicated in the treatment of amyloid nephrotic syndrome ."
"renal amyloidosis.. a biopsy study . the relationship of the amount of amyloid deposition in the kidney to the clinical picture is reviewed in 14 cases of renal amyloidosis diagnosed by renal biopsy . the large percentage of patients who had the nephrotic syndrome (11 patients) probably reflects the criteria for renal biopsy at this institution . the etiology of the amyloid deposition did not seem to be clearly correlated with either the amount of amyloid deposition in the kidney or the severity of the clinical renal disease . all patients had deposits in the glomerulus, and the heavier the deposition the severer the renal disease . of 7 patients who had biopsy of the bone marrow, all had abnormal types or numbers of plasma cells . the age range in primary amyloidosis appeared to be about the same as that in amyloidosis secondary to myeloma . amyloidosis should be suspected in patients with proteinuria, the nephrotic syndrome, or renal failure ."

"amyloid.. starch gel electrophoretic analysis of some proteins extracted from amyloid . proteins extracted by strong urea from washed tissue of patients with amyloidosis secondary to several diseases or associated with familial mediterranean fever have common major electrophoretic components . in hearts of primary amyloidosis one component in common with the secondary amyloid may be present . however, primary amyloid is much more difficult to dissolve and does not regularly give the components observed when the secondary amyloid is extracted . the big question remains as to what constituent or constituents comprise the fibrils now known to be a part of amyloid ."
"selectivity of protein excretion in patients with the nephrotic syndrome. with a gel diffusion precipitin technique and commercially prepared antisera, urine/plasma ratios of specific proteins were determined . individual protein clearances, expressed as a percentage of transferrin clearance, were plotted as ordinates against respective molecular weights on a log-log graph . a straight line was evident graphically, its constants were estimated by the method of least squares, and the slope, expressed as , was determined . the slope of the line may be said to express the degree of glomerular selectivity to protein excretion . sixty-five determinations were performed in 48 patients . 45 satisfying the usual criteria of the nephrotic syndrome . 1) those patients with primary renal disease and the nephrotic syndrome who displayed high selectivity types of proteinuria ( greater than the average for the group + 1 sd) usually respond initially to steroid therapy, regardless of the acute or subacute glomerular changes observed on renal biopsy . 2) those patients with chronic renal disease and the nephrotic syndrome display an average and frequently a low selectivity type of proteinuria . 3) there appears to be no characteristic type of selectivity for a given pathologic group of patients with the nephrotic syndrome . 4) the degree of selective protein excretion is not related to the total daily amount of protein being excreted at any one time and remains fairly constant despite fluctuation in the amount of protein being excreted . 5) there is a slight correlation of borderline significance between the degree of selective protein excretion and the duration of the disease, and the initial para-aminohippuric acid clearance . 6) a statistically significant correlation exists between the initial blood urea nitrogen or inulin clearance and the selectivity type of protein excretion . those patients who were not azotemic and had initially near-normal inulin clearances had an average selectivity type or better . 7) it is suggested that if the adult patient is initially azotemic and has a grossly abnormal inulin clearance, response to therapy is unlikely, whereas if the blood urea nitrogen is normal and the inulin clearance is near normal, response to therapy cannot be predicted with any degree of accuracy . further studies of adult patients with the nephrotic syndrome are required to substantiate this premise ."
"some aspects of haemostasis after open-heart surgery . synopsis in two groups of patients undergoing extracorporeal circulation with hypothermia, changes were found in the coagulation mechanism which were probably due to the dosage of polybrene administered . the role of heparin and polybrene and the concept of activation of the coagulation mechanism in the production of bleeding after perfusion are discussed ."
a case of interventricular septal defect with dextrocardia and situs inversus treated by surgery . a case of interventricular septal defect associated with situs inversus and dextrocardia in twenty year old male patient was presented along with discussion on three types of dextrocardial complexes and with emphasis on the rarity of occurrence of the intracardiac anomalies in true /mirror-image/ dextrocardia with total situs inversus . a comment was also made on kartagener's syndrome which was excluded by appropriate radiographic procedures in this case . the closure of the interventricular septal defect with extracorporeal circulation was successfully performed under moderate hypothermia .
"excretion patterns of urinary metabolites of estradiol-4-c14 in postmenopausal women with benign and malignant disease of the breast . a study of the excretion patterns of the urinary metabolites of estradiol-4-c1j administered to a group of 43 postmenopausal women, 38 with advanced mammary carcinoma prior to endocrine therapy and 5 with benign mammary dysplasia, is reported . a chromatographic method was employed for the determination of estradiol, estrone, and estriol and other estrogen metabolites . the urinary excretion pattern is defined by (a) the extent of excretion of isotope in each of 3 successive 24-hr. collection periods, (b) the percentage of the urinary radiometabolites enzymatically hydrolyzed, (c) the relative concentration of the several metabolites in the hydrolyzed fraction . wide subject-to-subject variations were found . the metabolites other than estradiol, estrone, and estriol comprised a large portion of the total estrogens excreted . a significantly lower amount of estradiol was noted in the group of women with mammary carcinoma as compared to the amount found in the group of women with benign mammary dysplasia, suggesting that the former group metabolizes more rapidly the administered estradiol . although the excretion patterns of patients who failed to respond to estrogen treatment (nonresponders) differed the greatest from the patterns associated with benign disease, distinctive patterns of the urinary excretion of isotopic estrogens which allowed a statistically significant or clinically useful separation between responders and nonresponders to subsequent estrogen therapy were not discovered ."
the localizing significance of limited simultaneous visual form perception . a patient presenting with an isolated /spelling dyslexia/ and impairment in picture interpretation (simultanagnosia) was shown by tachistoscopic studies to have a pathological limitation of simultaneous form perception . at autopsy a localized lesion was found within the inferior part of the left occipital lobe . these findings are discussed in relation to the problem of the disorder of function underlying /agnosic alexia/ .
visual anosognosia in cortical blindness anton's symptom . denial of blindness in a case of bilateral hemianopia is presented to acquaint ophthalmologists with this symptom which is well-known to neurologists but is rarely seen by opthalmologists .
"the development of social attachments in infancy . this report is devoted to the formation and development of social attachments in infancy . it is suggested that the core of the attachment function is represented by the tendency of the young to seek the proximity of certain other members of the species and that the most suitable operational definition may be found in the behavior of the individual when deprived of such proximity . the study takes the form of a longitudinal follow-up, in which 60 infants were investigated at four-weekly intervals from the early weeks on up to the end of the first year and again at 18 months of age . with the use of an attachment scale, based on seven everyday separation situations, the following three main parameters were explored.. the age at onset of specific attachments, the intensity of such attachments, and the number of objects to whom attachments are formed . a measure of fear-of-strangers was also included . results indicate that the age at onset of specific attachments is generally to be found in the third quarter of the first year, but that this is preceded by a phase of indiscriminate attachment behavior,. that the intensity of specific attachment increases most in the first month following onset and that thereafter fluctuations occur in individual cases which make long-term prediction difficult,. and that multiplicity of objects can be found in some instances at the very beginning of the specific attachment phase, becoming the rule in most of the remaining cases very soon thereafter . correlations between the attachment variables, as well as with the fear-of-strangers measure, are presented, and an examination is also made of the conditions eliciting protest at proximity loss, of the manner in which protest is expressed, and of the conditions necessary to terminate protest . individual differences with regard to the three main parameters were explored in a subgroup of 36 infants . a number of variables were examined in relation to these individual differences, and suggestions made regarding the conditions which affect the manifestation of the attachment function . the data are discussed in relation to four themes which emerged from the findings.. the nature of the attachment function, its developmental origins, its developmental trends, and the influence of the social setting ."
"separation anxiety as a cause of early emotional problems in children . in summary, three cases of disturbed behavior in children have been discussed, with particular emphasis on disturbances in feeding, sleeping, and motility . some of the hypotheses have been presented of why such behavior should develop,. the significance of attachment behavior and separation anxiety in infants has been particularly stressed . difficulties in mothering care are threatening to the child's sense of security and lead to greater experience of separation anxiety, which may then be reflected in various disturbances or alterations in his behavior . this experience of separation anxiety is the result of early life experience, may reach pathologic proportions, and may account for many later problems in children and adults ."
"the production of malignant tumours by nickel in the rat . powdered metallic nickel when injected intramuscularly into rats produced tumours of striated muscle origin, most of which were very well differentiated ."
"studies of nickel carcinogenesis fractionations of nickel in ultracentrifugal supernatants of lung and liver by means of dextran gel chromatography . chromatographic fractionations have been performed on the ultracentrifugal supernatants of homogenates of rat lung and liver by the use of columns of dextran gel (sephadex g-100) . a major proportion of nickel in these tissue supernatants has been demonstrated to be firmly bound to macromolecular constituents . following acute and chronic inhalation of carcinogenic levels of nickel carbonyl, the predominant increases in the concentrations of nickel have been observed in the macromolecular fractions . these findings are consistent with the previous demonstration of nickel in purified preparations of ribonucleic acids (rna) from several rat tissues, and with the observation of increased concentrations of nickel in high-molecular weight rna from lung and liver following the inhalation of nickel carbonyl ."
"a study of the inhibitory effect of ethylenediaminetetra-acetic acid on the thrombin-fibrinogen reaction . 1. ethylenediaminetetra-acetic acid reversibly inhibits the thrombin-fibrinogen reaction by means of a time-dependent diminution in fibrinogen reactivity . 2. this alteration of fibrinogen is due to some property of the edta molecule in an unchelated form, and is not due to the removal of trace metal ions . 3. possible explanations for this phenomenon are discussed ."
"intradermal test using cobalt chloride . selected groups of patients with cobalt allergy and nickel allergy as well as normal controls were tested intradermally with cobalt chloride in the dilutions 10 to 10 . reactions of the wheal and flare type appear during the first hours and make the 24-hour reading misleading . the papular response to cobalt chloride 10, when read 48 to 96 hours after the injection, appears to be a reliable test for cobalt allergy . patients with combined nickel-cobalt allergy were excluded from the study, and the question of group reactions is not discussed . nickel allergics give a somewhat stronger reaction than controls to the slightly impure cobalt chloride . it would be preferable if the degree of purity of the cobalt chloride were ten times greater ."
"measurements of nickel in biological materials by atomic absorption spectrometry . an atomic absorption procedure has been developed which facilitates quantitative measurements of nickel in biological materials, including urine, ribonucleic acids (rna), and serum proteins . the sensitivity of detection of nickel by the atomic absorption spectrometer (0.10 p.p.m.) was insufficient to permit direct measurements of nickel in normal urine . therefore, it was necessary to employ a dimethylglyoxime extraction procedure to concentrate the nickel, prior to atomic absorption spectrometry . the coefficients of variation of measurements of nickel in urine and human b- globulins were 6.3 and 5.9 per cent, respectively . the recovery of nickel added to urine averaged 96 per cent, with a range from 94 to 97, and the recovery of nickel added to human b-globulin averaged 101 per cent, with a range from 96 to 104 . the mean concentration of nickel in 24-hr. collections of urine from 17 normal subjects was 1.8 ug. per 100 ml. (s.d. = 0.8), with a range from 0.4 to 3.1 . the mean urinary excretion of nickel was 19.8 ug. per 24 hr. (s.d. = 10.0), with a range from 7.2 to 37.6 . the mean concentration of nickel in 5 preparations of ribonucleic acids from ultracentrifugal supernatants of homogenates of rat lung was 48 ug. of ni per gm. of rna, with a range from 34 to 64 . the mean concentration of nickel in 5 preparations of rna from ultracentrifugal supernatants of homogenates of rat liver was 29 ug. of ni per gm. of rna, with a range from 21 to 39 . measurements of nickel were performed upon fractions of human serum proteins, prepared by continuous-flow electrophoresis, and by cold-ethanol precipitation . the highest concentrations of nickel were found in preparations of serum b-globulins ."
"properties of activity of 5'-nucleotidase in human serum, and applications in diagnosis . the influence of mg , ni , and l-histidine on purified preparations of bone and intestinal alkaline phosphatases and 5'-nucleotidase, and on various mixtures of these enzymes has been studied . the extent to which these findings can be utilized in the quantitative assay of 5'-nucleotidase in serum has been evaluated . results are presented on the possible utilization of l-histodine in the simultaneous evaluation of serum alkaline phosphatase and 5'-nucleotidase activity ."
"some 2-iminoselenazolidin-4-ones and related compounds . a series of 2-iminoselenazolidin-4-ones, selenazolidine-2,4-diones and some 2-alkylidenehydrazones have been synthesised . wide-range screening for biological activity failed to reveal any compounds of promise ."
"the influence of methemoglobinemia on the lethality of some toxic anions, 1. azide . the time course and extent of the methemoglobinemia induced by intraperitoneal sodium nitrite and p-aminopropiophenone (papp) have been characterized in female mice . the peak methemoglobin formation (34 ) is achieved in about 40 minutes . comparable levels from papp (15 mg/kg) are achieved more quickly (between 5 and 10 minutes) but decline more rapidly to normal . both nitrite- and papp-induced methemoglobinemia afford a significant degree of protection against poisoning by sodium azide when administered in an appropriate time sequence . it was not possible under the same circumstances to protect mice against death from fluoride, cyanate, thiocyanate, selenate, or borate, although some prolongation of survival time was seen after fluoride . the formation of the azide-methemoglobin complex has been demonstrated within intact mouse red blood cells, and small amounts of the complex were identified in vivo in an antidotal situation . we think it important that the protective action of methemoglobinemia has been demonstrated to date only against established inhibitors of cytochrome oxidase ."

"experimental investigation of the aerodynamics of a wing in a slipstream . an experimental study of a wing in a propeller slipstream was made in order to determine the spanwise distribution of the lift increase due to slipstream at different angles of attack of the wing and at different free stream to slipstream velocity ratios .  the results were intended in part as an evaluation basis for different theoretical treatments of this problem . the comparative span loading curves, together with supporting evidence, showed that a substantial part of the lift increment produced by the slipstream was due to a /destalling/ or boundary-layer-control effect .  the integrated remaining lift increment, after subtracting this destalling lift, was found to agree well with a potential flow theory . an empirical evaluation of the destalling effects was made for the specific configuration of the experiment ."
"simple shear flow past a flat plate in an incompressible fluid of small viscosity . in the study of high-speed viscous flow past a two-dimensional body it is usually necessary to consider a curved shock wave emitting from the nose or leading edge of the body .  consequently, there exists an inviscid rotational flow region between the shock wave and the boundary layer .  such a situation arises, for instance, in the study of the hypersonic viscous flow past a flat plate .  the situation is somewhat different from prandtl's classical boundary-layer problem . in prandtl's original problem the inviscid free stream outside the boundary layer is irrotational while in a hypersonic boundary-layer problem the inviscid free stream must be considered as rotational .  the possible effects of vorticity have been recently discussed by ferri and libby .  in the present paper, the simple shear flow past a flat plate in a fluid of small viscosity is investigated .  it can be shown that this problem can again be treated by the boundary-layer approximation, the only novel feature being that the free stream has a constant vorticity .  the discussion here is restricted to two-dimensional incompressible steady flow ."

"piston theory - a new aerodynamic tool for the aeroelastician . representative applications are described which illustrate the extent to which simplifications in the solutions of high-speed unsteady aeroelastic problems can be achieved through the use of certain aerodynamic techniques known collectively as /piston theory ./  based on a physical model originally proposed by hayes and lighthill, piston theory for airfoils and finite wings has been systematically developed by landahl, utilizing expansions in powers of the thickness ratio and the inverse of the flight mach number m .  when contributions of orders and are negligible, the theory predicts a point-function relationship between the local pressure on the surface of a wing and the normal component of fluid velocity produced by the wing's motion .  the computation of generalized forces in aeroelastic equations, such as the flutter determinant, is then always reduced to elementary integrations of the assumed modes of motion . essentially closed-form solutions are given for the bending- torsion and control-surface flutter properties of typical section airfoils at high mach numbers .  these agree well with results of more exact theories wherever comparisons can be fairly made . moreover, they demonstrate the increasingly important influence of thickness and profile shape as m grows larger, a discovery that would be almost impossible using other available aerodynamic tools .  the complexity of more practical flutter analyses-e.g., on three-dimensional wings and panels-is shown to be substantially reduced by piston theory .  an iterative procedure is outlined, by which improved flutter eigenvalues can be found through the successive introduction of higher-order terms in and  . other applications to unsteady supersonic problems are reviewed, including gust response and rapid maneuvers of elastic aircraft .  steady-state aeroelastic calculations are also discussed, but for them piston theory amounts only to a slight modification of ackeret's formulas . suggestions are made regarding future research based on the new aerodynamic method, with particular emphasis on areas where computational labor can be reduced with a minimum loss of precision .  it is pointed out that a mach number zone exists where thermal effects are appreciable but nonlinear viscous interactions may be neglected, and that in this zone piston theory is the logical way of estimating air loads when analyzing aerodynamic- thermoelastic interaction problems ."
"on two-dimensional panel flutter . theory and experiments of the flutter of a buckled plate are discussed .  it is shown that an increase in the initial deviation from flatness or a static pressure differential across the plate raises the critical value of the /reduced velocity ./ the applicability of the galerkin method to the linearized problem of flutter of an unbuckled plate has been questioned by several authors .  in this paper the flutter condition was formulated in the form of an integral equation and solved numerically by the method of iteration and the method of matrix approximations, thus avoiding the constraint of assumed modes .  for a plate (with finite bending rigidity) the results confirm those given by the galerkin method . an approximate analysis of the limiting form and amplitude of the flutter motion for a buckled plate is presented ."

"remarks on the eddy viscosity in compressible mixing flows . in connection with a study of the wakes behind bodies in hypersonic flow carried out for the missile and space vehicle division of the general electric company, it was desired to estimate the eddy viscosity in axisymmetric, compressible wakes .  because of the lack of applicable experimental data, it was found necessary to make such an estimate by rationally extending the few available data for incompressible flows to the compressible case .  this suggested the application and extension of the transformations applied to turbulent boundary layers in reference infinitesimal mass are invariant with transformation, mager showed that the partial differential equations for the compressible turbulent boundary layer can be transformed to incompressible form .  the validity of this assumption and of the transformations was established for several boundary-layer flows by comparison with experiment ."

"theory of stagnation point heat transfer in dissociated air . the boundary-layer equations are developed in general for the case of very high speed flight where the external flow is in a dissociated state .  in particular the effects of diffusion and of atom recombination in the boundary layer are included .  it is shown that at the stagnation point the equations can be reduced exactly to a set of nonlinear ordinary differential equations even when the chemical reactions proceed so slowly that the boundary layer is not in thermochemical equilibrium . two methods of numerical solution of these stagnation point equations are presented, one for the equilibrium case and the other for the nonequilibrium case .  numerical results are correlated in terms of the parameters entering the numerical formulation so as not to depend critically on the physical assumptions made . for the nonequilibrium boundary layer, both catalytic (to atom recombination) and noncatalytic wall surfaces are considered .  a solution is represented which shows the transition from the /frozen/ boundary layer (very slow recombination rates) to the equilibrium boundary layer (fast recombination rates) . a recombination rate parameter is introduced to interpret the nonequilibrium results, and it is shown that a scale factor is involved in relating the equilibrium state of a boundary layer on bodies of different sizes . it is concluded that the heat transfer through the equilibrium stagnation point boundary layer can be computed accurately by a simple correlation formula and that the heat transfer is almost unaffected by a nonequilibrium state of the boundary layer provided the wall is catalytic and the lewis number near unity ."
"inviscid hypersonic flow over blunt-nosed slender bodies . at hypersonic speeds the drag area of a blunt nose is much larger than the drag area of a slender afterbody, and the energy contained in the flow field in a plane at right angles to the flight direction is nearly constant over a downstream distance many times greater than the characteristic nose dimension .  the transverse flow field exhibits certain similarity properties directly analogous to the flow similarity behind an intense blast wave found by g. i. taylor, s. c. lin, and a. sakurai .  a comparison with the experiments of hammitt, vas, and bogdonoff on a flat plate with a blunt leading edge at in helium shows that the shock-wave shape is predicted very accurately by this similarity analysis .  the predicted surface pressure distribution is somewhat less satisfactory .  experimental results on a hemisphere-cylinder obtained at in the galcit air tunnel indicate that not only the shock-wave shape but also the surface pressures for this body are given very closely by the similarity theory, except near the hemisphere-cylinder junction . energy considerations combined with a detailed study of the equations of motion show that flow similarity is also possible for a class of bodies of the form, provided that, where for a two-dimensional body and for a body of revolution .  when the shock shape is not similar to the body shape, and the entire flow field some distance from the nose must depend to some extent on the details of the nose geometry . by again utilizing energy and drag considerations one finds that at hypersonic speeds the inviscid surface pressures generated by a blunt leading edge are larger than the pressures induced by boundary-layer growth on an insulated flat surface for an insulated blunt-nosed slender body of revolution the corresponding distance is given by .  (here is free-stream reynolds number based on leading-edge thickness, or nose diameter .)  in free flight these constants are replaced by 1,700 and 20, respectively, so that viscous interaction effects are important over the forward portion of a blunt- nosed slender body only for relatively low values of . however, /far downstream/ of the nose the inviscid over-pressure is small and viscous interaction phenomena will have to be taken into account ."

"the dynamic motion of a missile descending through the atmosphere . a method is presented for computing rapidly, yet accurately, the dynamic motion of a ballistic-type missile descending through the atmosphere .  the equations of motion are separated into a set of /static/ trajectory equations (zero angle of attack) and a set of /rotational/ equations describing the oscillatory motion of the missile about its center of gravity .  a transformation allows the rotational equations to be written in a manner analogous to the equation for an undamped oscillating spring mass system with the mass equal to unity and a time variable spring constant .  for given initial conditions this equation can be solved to obtain the envelope of maximum angle of attack .  an additional transformation allows the calculation of the complete oscillatory motion at any time during the trajectory as a function of the maximum angle of attack at that time . this solution shows that the maximum angle of attack of a missile descending through the atmosphere at relatively constant speed is reduced even when the aerodynamic damping is neglected ."
"the prospects for magneto-aerodynamics . the equations describing the flow of an electrically conducting fluid in the presence of electric and magnetic fields are written down with the aid of certain simplifications appropriate to aeronautical applications .  in order to estimate the probable significance of magneto-aerodynamic effects, some data on conductivity of pure and /seeded/ air are first examined . dimensionless quantities representing the ratios of forces and of currents are then formed and their values studied for conditions of flight in the atmosphere . some examples of magneto-hydrodynamic and magneto- gasdynamic effects in simple flows are given .  these include two cases of poiscuille flow of conducting liquids with applied magnetic fields and the case of quasi-one-dimensional gas flow with applied electrical and magnetic fields .  in the last case, attractive possibilities are found for controlled acceleration or deceleration of gas at subsonic and supersonic speeds, even in constant-area channels .  the behavior of the flow is characteristically different in different regimes of mach number and flow speed relative to certain /significant speeds/ that are dependent on the ratio of electrical to magnetic field strengths .  these are studied, and a chart is constructed to relate the length to the speed ratio of a maximum-acceleration constant-area channel . it is concluded that the advantages that may accrue from magneto-aerodynamic methods are sufficiently attractive to justify the considerable research and engineering development that will be required .  among the unsolved engineering problems are the reduction of surface resistance of electrodes in contact with a conducting gas, development of techniques for seeding, and provision of the required magnetic fields in flight ."
"constant-temperature magneto-gasdynamic channel flow . in the course of investigating boundary-layer flow in continuous plasma accelerators with crossed electric and magnetic fields, it was found advantageous to have at hand simple closed-form solutions for the magneto-gasdynamic flow in the duct which could serve as free-stream conditions for the boundary layers .  nontrivial solutions of this sort are not available at present, and in fact, as in the work of resler and sears, the variation of conditions along the flow axis must be obtained through numerical integration . consequently, some simple solutions of magneto-gasdynamic channel flow were sought, possessing sufficient algebraic simplicity to serve as free-stream boundary conditions for analytic investigations of the boundary layer in a physically reasonable accelerator . in particular, since the cooling of the accelerator tube is likely to be an important physical problem because of the high gas temperatures required to provide sufficient gaseous conductivity, channel flow with constant temperature appears interesting . some simple algebraic solutions for the case of a constant temperature plasma are developed in the following paragraphs ."

"a new technique for investigating heat transfer and surface phenomena under hypersonic flow conditions . on the forebody of many practically interesting hypersonic vehicles, there is little interaction between the inviscid flow field and the boundary layer .  therefore, inviscid flow theory can be used to determine, independent of surface phenomena, the physically interesting quantities such as shock shape, shock detachment distance, sonic line shape, and pressure distribution . furthermore, the pressure distribution so determined can then be used for the study of heat transfer, materials behavior, and other surface phenomena .  thus, for these bodies, the prandtl boundary-layer concept can be utilized for the calculation of both the inviscid flow and the boundary-layer behavior . it is the purpose of this note to point out that this concept can also be applied experimentally in order to provide, in conjunction with a conventional hypersonic wind-tunnel air supply, a means for investigating hypersonic heat transfer and surface phenomena under conditions of flight reynolds numbers ."

"the gyroscopic effect of a rigid rotating propeller on engine and wing vibration modes . in many wing vibration analyses it is found necessary to take into account the effect of flexibly mounted engines .  hence, it is reasonable to ask what vibratory gyroscopic effect this flexibility may give rise to when propellers are whirling .  an engine mount may be thought of as a horizontal beam cantilevered from the wing, having both horizontal and vertical flexibility . if this beam were infinitely rigid horizontally, then, when it vibrated, the gyroscopic moments induced in the propeller due to the resultant pitching motion of its axis would not produce propeller axis yaw .  however, engine-mount lateral stiffness tical stiffness, so that gyroscopic effects will play a role as the propeller axis undergoes pitching vibrations at the tip of the cantilever engine mount .  the purpose of this paper is to investigate this role under the assumption that the propeller itself is a rigid disc . the paper is divided into four parts .  part (1) deals briefly with classical gyroscope theory .  part (2) presents engine vibration mode studies-experimental photographic techniques on a model gyroscope mounted at the ends of two different cantilever beams .  part (3) presents the theory of the coupled motion of an elastic wing upon which a gyroscope is mounted to simulate an engine-propeller system on an airplane .  part (4) consists of an example of the theory of part (3), in which, by taking what are thought to be reasonable parameters, results are obtained showing how the whirling of a rigid propeller may materially affect wing normal mode shapes and frequencies ."
"the relation between wall temperature and the effect of roughness on boundary layer transition . the experimentally demonstrated rise and subsequent fall of transition reynolds number with decreasing wall- to-ambient temperature ratio has been the subject of two recent notes .  in both cases it was argued that the increased effectiveness of roughness due to wall cooling was not sufficient to explain the transition-reversal phenomenon on nominally smooth bodies .  in one case, the criterion for transition reversal was taken to be and in the other values of as low as eter is a reynolds number formed from velocity and kinematic viscosity based on calculated conditions at the height of roughness element k in the undisturbed, laminar boundary layer at the station of roughness location .  the present note is submitted to show that another method for evaluating the effect of roughness on transition leads to an opposite conclusion ."
"tip-bluntness effects on cone pressures at m=6.85 . there is, at present, considerable interest in the characteristies of blunted bodies from both an aerodynamic and a heat-transfer standpoint .  the use of blunt shapes is contemplated to reduce the heat-transfer problem at body noses, but there are also applications for blunt noses which occur from mainly aerodynamic considerations .  an actual reduction in drag may be the beneficial result of blunting the nose of a cone or a similar slender shape under certain conditions .  although the sphere has received considerable treatment, the nose shapes are not necessarily tangent spheres .  in the case, let us say, of a total head tube situated in the nose of a given body, the blunting may be quite flat, and nose sections blunter than spherical shape may conceivably be desirable, in some cases, from the heat- transfer standpoint . the purpose of the present investigation is to examine the aerodynamic effect of a simple type of nose blunting on a basic body . the incompressible flow of an electrically conducting fluid past a porous plate y = 0 with constant suction velocity in the presence of a transverse uniform strength has recently been investigated by gupta .  in this note, the problem is generalized to take into account the effect of free convection, when a body force g per unit mass is acting in the negative x-direction parallel to the wall .  the fluid is assumed to be semi- incompressible as usual .  in addition to the obvious practical significance, this problem is also interesting in the sense that it provides another exact solution of the magnetohydrodynamic equations, since the only electromagnetic assumptions involved are constant properties and freedom from excessive charges ."
"an investigation of separated flows, part ii: flow in the cavity and heat transfer . the first portion of this paper describes studies of the internal structure of the separated flow in a notch at a free-stream mach number of 3 .  observations include..  flow visualization, spark- schlieren pictures of the fluctuations of the free shear layer, and studies of the diffusion of heat from sources placed in the separated region .  the second part describes measurements of local heat transfer to the wall . the external mach number, the length-to-depth ratio of the cavity, the ratio of the oncoming boundary layer thickness to the notch depth (in the turbulent flow region), the thermal to-momentum thickness ratio of the boundary layer and, finally, the geometry of the internal boundary of the separated region are varied as systematically as possible .  on the basis of these observations, a simple model of the flow in and the heat transfer across the separated region is formulated ."
some comments on the inversion of certain large matrices . the subject of matric structural analysis has been treated in two recently published papers in the journal .  the authors of these papers have made a number of statements about the inversion of certain large matrices .  it is the purpose of this note to bring to the attention of the reader certain facts that shed new light on this important problem . it is shown here that the situation is not as hopeless as the above- mentioned authors intimate .
"analysis of low-aspect-ratio aircraft structures . two methods are presented for the analysis of complex low- aspect-ratio aircraft structures .  both methods provide for arbitrary external loading, are general with respect to the orientation of structural members, and permit arbitrary boundary conditions .  for purposes of analysis a structure is idealized as a network of flexural members with interconnected torsion boxes . in the first method, sets of linear equations are obtained by expressing boundary conditions, member deflection equations, equilibrium requirements, and slope-compatibility relationships in terms of deflections and internal forces .  the solution for deflections and internal forces is then formed as the product of an inverse structural matrix and a column matrix of load functions . in the second method, the conditions at a given boundary are assembled as a column matrix and are transferred in a step by-step fashion over the entire structure to an opposite boundary . the transfer is accomplished by successive multiplications of square matrices composed independently for the different transfer ranges .  the final operation is the inversion of a relatively small matrix and provides the solution for the unknown boundary conditions . comparisons of theoretical results with experimental data and electric-analog solutions are favorable ."
"supersonic flow at the surface of a circular cone at angle of attack . formulas for the inviscid flow properties on the surface of a cone at angle of attack are derived for use in conjunction with the m.i.t. cone tables .  these formulas are based upon an entropy distribution on the cone surface which is uniform and equal to that of the shocked fluid in the windward meridian plane .  they predict values for the flow variables which may differ significantly from the corresponding values obtained directly from the cone tables .  the differences in the magnitudes of the flow variables computed by the two methods tend to increase with increasing free-stream mach number, cone angle and angle of attack ."
"temperature and velocity profiles in the compressible laminar boundary layer with arbitrary distribution of surface temperature . an analysis is presented which enables the temperature profiles, veiocity profiles, heat transfer, and skin friction to be calculated for laminar flow over a two-dimensional or axially symmetric surface without pressure gradient but with an arbitrary analytic distribution of surface temperature .  the general theory is applicable to a gas of any prandtl number, although the numerical results given herein have been computed for air . the predictions of the theory for the special case of constant surface temperature are compared with the calculations of crocco . on the basis of this comparison, it is inferred that the present theory enables heat-transfer and skin-friction calculations accurate to within about 5 per cent to be made for flight conditions up to mach numbers near 5 and to within about 1 or 2 per cent for supersonic wind-tunnel conditions up to considerably higher mach numbers . a particular effort has been made to present the results, which are simple considering their generality, in a form that can be used readily in practical applications .  from the mathematical point of view, the theory is applicable to an arbitrary analytic distribution of surface temperature, but in any given practical case it is necessary that the surface-temperature distribution be approximated by a polynomial .  the only unknowns in the final equations developed are the coefficients of this polynomial, so that the work involved in applying the theory in any given case depends entirely on the work involved in approximating a given surface- temperature distribution by a polynomial . an example is worked out in detail which illustrates some of the principal effects of variable surface temperature .  it is shown that both positively infinite and negatively infinite heat-transfer coefficients can occur .  the anomaly of infinite and negative heat-transfer coefficients is discussed and attributed to the customary definition of the heat-transfer coefficient, which is shown to be fundamentally inappropriate for flows with variable surface temperature .  in the particular example considered, a conventional method for calculating the net heat transferred yields completely incorrect results .  a brief qualitative discussion of the possible effects of the heat transfer on flow separation is given . in order to facilitate the use of the results, all of the principal equations developed are collected and summarized in the section entitled /practical use of results ./"
"investigation of laminar boundary layer in compressible fluids using the crocco method . in the present investigation of the flow of air in a thin laminar boundary layer on a flat plate, the crocco method has been used to solve the simultaneous differential equations of momentum and energy involved in such flow .  the crocco method was used because it gave accurate results for arbitrary prandtl number near unity .  the prandtl number was taken at 0.75, the specific heat was held constant, and the sutherland law of viscosity-temperature variation was assumed to represent the viscosity data starting with an initial ambient temperature of -67.6 f .  the main results presented here are the skin-friction and heat-transfer coefficients as functions of reynolds number, mach number, and wall-to-free-stream temperature ratio .  variations of shear, velocity, temperature, and mach number across the boundary layer are included .  the crocco method is discussed in detail ."
