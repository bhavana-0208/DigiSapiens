"The present study is a history of the DEWEY Decimal Classification.  The first edition of the DDC was published in 1876, the eighteenth edition in 1971, and future editions will continue to appear as needed.  In spite of the DDC's long and healthy life, however, its full story has never been told.  There have been biographies of Dewey that briefly describe his system, but this is the first attempt to provide a detailed history of the work that more than any other has spurred the growth of librarianship in this country and abroad."
"This report is an analysis of 6300 acts of use in 104 technical libraries in the United Kingdom. Library use is only one aspect of the wider pattern of information use.  Information transfer in libraries is restricted to the use of documents.  It takes no account of documents used outside the library, still less of information transferred orally from person to person.  The library acts as a channel in only a proportion of the situations in which information is transferred. Taking technical information transfer as a whole, there is no doubt that this proportion is not the major one.  There are users of technical information - particularly in technology rather than science - who visit libraries rarely if at all, relying on desk collections of handbooks, current periodicals and personal contact with their colleagues and with people in other organizations.  Even regular library users also receive information in other ways."
"The relationships between the organization and control of writings and the organization and control of knowledge and information will inevitably enter our story, for writings contain, along with much else, a great deal of mankind's stock of knowledge and information.  Bibliographical control is a form of power, and if knowledge itself is a form of power, as the familiar slogan claims, bibliographical control is in a certain sense power over power, power to obtain the knowledge recorded in written form.  As writings are not simply, and not in any simple way, storehouses of knowledge, we cannot satisfactorily discuss bibliographical control as simply control over the knowledge and information contained in writings."
"The establishment of nine new universities in the 1960's provoked a highly stimulating re-examination of the nature, purpose and management of academic libraries.  Long-established attitudes and methods were questioned, but although changes were made, the basic difficulty remained - a lack of objective information about the best ways of providing a library service in a university. The report of the UGC Committee on Libraries (the Parry Repot [267]), which, in general, endorsed these changes, also stressed the need for research into all aspects of academic library provision."
"Although the use of games in professional education has become widespread only during the last decade, the method has been used in a number of fields for many hundreds of years. Its origins have been traced to simple war games, used in military training when the ""real thing"" was either unavailable or too dangerous.  In more recent times, these games have become more and more sophisticated, and many now use large electronic computers to handle the complex calculations involved. Since 1956, when the first well-developed management game was introduced, the technique has spread rapidly into a wide variety of disciplines and today it is used at all levels of education, from primary school classes to courses for experienced professional men and women.  One of the main causes of this ""game explosion"" has been the rapid development of sophisticated management techniques, such as simulation and mathematical modelling, which have been made possible by rapid advances in computer technology."
"Graduate library school study of abstracting should be more than a how-to-do-it course. It should include general material on the characteristcs and types of abstracts, the historical development of abstracting publications, the abstract-publishing industry (especially in the United States), and the need for standards in the preparation and evaluation of the product. These topics we call concepts. The text includes a methods section containing instructions for writing various types of abstracts, and for editing and preparing abstracting publications. These detailed instructions are supplemented by examples and exercises in the appendix. There is a brief discussion of indexing of abstract publications. Research on automation has been treated extensively in this work, for we believe that the topic deserves greater emphasis than it has received in the past. Computer use is becoming increasingly important in all aspects of librarianship. Much research effort has been expended on the preparation and evaluation of computer-prepared abstracts and extracts. Students, librarians, and abstractors will benefit from knowing about this research and understanding how computer programs were researched to analyze text, select key sentences, and prepare extracts and abstracts. The benefits of this research are discussed. Abstracting is a key segment of the information industry. Opportunities are available for both full-time professionals and part-time or volunteer workers. Many librarians find such activities pleasant and rewarding, for they know they are contributing to the more effective use of stored information. One chapter is devoted to career opportunities for abstractors."
"This book attempts to present representative examples of successful architectural solutions to the important problems librarians and architects face in planning new college and university library buildings or in remodeling and enlarging existing structures.  It does not attempt to make case study evaluations, as was done by Ellsworth Mason for Brown and Yale.  Nor does it present examples of unsuccessful solutions except to show how to avoid mistakes, and in these cases the libraries will not be identified."
"As important for staff members' individual development as was the apprenticeship in administration, perhaps the most significant attitude one acquired while working for Guy was engendered by his insistence that librarians must be interested in and knowledgeable about the content of the materials with which they dealt.  His love of literature, his respect for scholarship, his admiration for good writing and reading were manifested in many ways, but most notably in his admonition that, though we were primarily a research library, we must constantly keep in mind our obligation to collect contemporary poetry, fiction and belles-letters.  It was primarily up to the library staff, he felt, to be responsible for these as well as for ""general"" books which crossed disciplinary lines or fell between the disciplines, those books which a faculty mostly concerned with research materials is apt to overlook.  And in building this portion of the collection, ""there is no substitute for a thorough acquaintance with books through a reading of critical reviews and the books themselves.""  This counsel is from The President, the Professor, and the College Library, but the importance of its thrust--the need to keep up with the world of books and publishing--was continually impressed upon us."
"This study assumed that an additional use study held less promise than an analytical consideration of concepts. The basic approach was a survey comparing traditional and current professional ideas on direct access.  Principal data-gathering instruments were documentary analysis and opinion questionnaire. Findings of the documentary analysis included the following: Research from 1890 to 1970 on the direct shelf approach and browsing left the problems largely unresolved and evidently resistant to established methods of use and user research.  The need for an exhaustive study of concepts was confirmed. Open shelf libraries--organized through shelf classification and relative location--were meant to arouse the intellectual, social, and political interest of the average citizen and affect his democratic self-realization. Definitions of ""browsing"" varied greatly: self-indulgence by the untutored in objectionable works; beneficial self-education for the general reader; valuable guidance for the scholar in his research."
"The purpose of this study was to develop, evaluate, and recommend a national plan  for improving access to periodical resources.  About 48 percent of all academic interlibrary loans are for periodical materials, with the bulk of the loans being satisfied in the form of photocopies.  A major consideration in the long-range improvement of the interlibrary loan system is the possible augmentation with a national system for acquiring, storing, and satisfying loan requests for periodical materials. This study focused on the physical access to the periodical literature.  Based on the needs of the library community, design features were developed, and included the following: Service should be made available to all users without any restriction other than access through a library. Initially, the service should be confined primarily to rapid, dependable delivery of photocopies of journal articles. The collection of a center should be comprehensive in subject coverage excluding only medicine. All worthwhile journals should be collected irrespective of language."
correlation between maternal and fetal plasma levels of glucose and free fatty acids . correlation coefficients have been determined between the levels of glucose and ffa in maternal and fetal plasma collected at delivery . significant correlations were obtained between the maternal and fetal glucose levels and the maternal and fetal ffa levels . from the size of the correlation coefficients and the slopes of regression lines it appears that the fetal plasma glucose level at delivery is very strongly dependent upon the maternal level whereas the fetal ffa level at delivery is only slightly dependent upon the maternal level .
"changes of the nucleic acid and phospholipid levels of the livers in the course of fetal and postnatal development . we have followed the evolution of dna, rna and pl in the livers of rat foeti removed between the fifteenth and the twenty-first day of gestation and of young rats newly-born or at weaning . we can observe the following facts.. 1. dna concentration is 1100 ug p on the 15th day, it decreases from the 19th day until it reaches a value of 280 ug 5 days after weaning . 2. rna concentration is 1400 ug p on the 15th day and decreases to 820 during the same period . 3. pl concentration is low on the 15th day and during foetal life (700 ug) and increases abruptly at birth . 4. the ratios rna cyto/dna and pl cyto/dna increase regularly from the 18th day of foetal life . 5. nuclear rna and pl contents are very high throughout the development . 6. these results enable us to characterize three stages in the development of the rat liver.. - from the 15th day to the 18th day of foetal life.. stage of growth through hyperplasia without hypertrophy, - from the 19th day of foetal life to the 3rd day of post-natal life,. stage of cellular reorganisation, - after the 3rd day of post-natal life.. stage of growth through hyperplasia and hypertrophy ."
"surfactant in fetal lamb tracheal fluid . lambs delivered by cesarean section with intact fetal circulation have a fluid filling the trachea . analysis revealed that this fluid contained material high in surface activity in lambs delivered near term, but less surface activity in premature lambs . administration of 10 per cent oxygen to the ewe for 1 hour prior to delivery did not alter the surfactant properties of the fetal tracheal fluid . two analyses of the fetal tracheal fluid revealed it to contain 146 and 198 mg. of lipid per 100 ml., 30 to 40 per cent of which was phospholipid, part of the active component of surfactant . the investigations reported here offer a model for further research into possible intrauterine factors in the pathogenesis of hyaline membrane disease ."
"placental and cord blood lipids.. comparison in a set of double ovum twins, a stillborn and a live-born . 1. determinations of phospholipid, total and free cholesterol, triglyceride and nefa have been made on placental tissue and cord blood in a set of double ovum twins, one stillborn and one live-born . 2. similarities occurred in all fractions studied except the cord blood triglyceride and nefa levels . 3. the serum of the stillborn infant contained one-third as much triglyceride and 21/2 times as much nefa as did the live-born infant . 4. the phospholipid content and the total lipid content of the stillbirth placenta were the highest studied in this laboratory which includes determinations on 26 live births . 5. the suggestion is made that increased lipoprotein lipase activity in the cord blood may accompany intrauterine fetal death ."
"free fatty acid concentration in maternal plasma and fetal body fat content . subcutaneous injection of 200 u.s.p. units of heparin into female sprague-dawley rats produced large and sustained elevations of plasma free fatty acids but no significant change in blood glucose . a group of pregnant rats received such injections of heparin 3 times daily throughout pregnancy . the fetuses from mothers of this group, at 191/2 and 211/2 days of gestation, had significantly more body fat than the fetuses from uninjected mothers . the hypothesis is presented that the maternal free fatty acid concentration in part determines fetal fat accumulation . it is proposed that the body composition changes noted in babies of mothers with diabetes might thus be ascribed to abnormally high maternal plasma free fatty acid concentrations ."
"the concentration of non-esterified fatty acids in maternal and fetal plasma in intact, alloxan-diabetic and x-ray-irradiated rats . determinations of the non-esterified fatty acids in the plasma of pregnant rats showed that there do not exist any increases in the concentrations depending on pregnancy during the period from the 20th - 22nd day of pregnancy . in the fetal plasma the concentrations of non-esterified fatty acids only amounted to 40 - 50 per cent of the maternal values . with alloxan diabetes produced 2 days prior to the test the concentration in the maternal plasma increased three- to fivefold, while at the same time a significant rise was absent in fetal plasma with slightly increased average values . whole-body x-ray exposures (dose.. 400r, dose output.. 40r/min) of non-pregnant female and of pregnant rats beginning on the 17th day of pregnancy did not result in any changes of the concentration of non-esterified fatty acids immediately after irradiation ."
"lipid metabolism in toxemia and normal pregnancy . the amount and fatty acid composition of total lipid extract from serum were examined in normal pregnant women in the first, second, and third trimesters, and early postpartum period, and in patients with mild and severe preeclampsia and with essential hypertension . placentas at term were also examined for total lipid and its fatty acid composition . in the normal women, total serum lipid increased during pregnancy . the rise was less pronounced in those with preeclampsia or hypertension . serum palmitate was mildly but significantly elevated in preeclampsia . total lipid and arachidonic acid were elevated in the placentas of preeclamptic women . the findings are compared with those obtained from animals developing eclampsia on an experimental basis ."
"essential fatty acids and acids with trans-configuration in the subcutaneous and visceral fat of the newborn . we made an investigation of the subcutaneous and visceral fat in the newborn . we estimated the contents of linolic and linolenic acid and of acids with trans-configuration spectrophotometrically . we were able to show the penetration of these acids through the placental barrier . the essential fatty acid contents of fat in the newborn is low . in immature ones about 7-14 g, there is a rising trend."
"acetoacetate formation by livers from human fetuses aged 8-17 weeks . slices and homogenates from livers of human fetuses aged 8-17 weeks have a low rate of acetoacetate formation which can be raised by addition of acetate or octanoate to the incubation medium . it was not possible to demonstrate acetoacetate formation by isolated liver mitochondria from 17-week-old fetuses, probably because mitochondria are injured during isolation ."
"changes in blood glucose and non-esterified fatty acids in the foetal and newborn lamb after injection of adrenaline . changes in blood glucose and non-esterified fatty acids after intravenous adrenaline were measured in foetal, newborn and adult sheep in the foetus and immediately after birth there was very little increase in either blood glucose or non-esterified fatty acids after adrenaline . the response of blood glucose to adrenaline had reached adult levels at twenty-four hours of age . the response of non-esterifi- ed fatty acids to adrenaline increased gradually over the first week ."
"experimental investigation of the aerodynamics of a wing in a slipstream . an experimental study of a wing in a propeller slipstream was made in order to determine the spanwise distribution of the lift increase due to slipstream at different angles of attack of the wing and at different free stream to slipstream velocity ratios .  the results were intended in part as an evaluation basis for different theoretical treatments of this problem . the comparative span loading curves, together with supporting evidence, showed that a substantial part of the lift increment produced by the slipstream was due to a /destalling/ or boundary-layer-control effect .  the integrated remaining lift increment, after subtracting this destalling lift, was found to agree well with a potential flow theory . an empirical evaluation of the destalling effects was made for the specific configuration of the experiment ."
"simple shear flow past a flat plate in an incompressible fluid of small viscosity . in the study of high-speed viscous flow past a two-dimensional body it is usually necessary to consider a curved shock wave emitting from the nose or leading edge of the body .  consequently, there exists an inviscid rotational flow region between the shock wave and the boundary layer .  such a situation arises, for instance, in the study of the hypersonic viscous flow past a flat plate .  the situation is somewhat different from prandtl's classical boundary-layer problem . in prandtl's original problem the inviscid free stream outside the boundary layer is irrotational while in a hypersonic boundary-layer problem the inviscid free stream must be considered as rotational .  the possible effects of vorticity have been recently discussed by ferri and libby .  in the present paper, the simple shear flow past a flat plate in a fluid of small viscosity is investigated .  it can be shown that this problem can again be treated by the boundary-layer approximation, the only novel feature being that the free stream has a constant vorticity .  the discussion here is restricted to two-dimensional incompressible steady flow ."
the boundary layer in simple shear flow past a flat plate . the boundary-layer equations are presented for steady incompressible flow with no pressure gradient .
"approximate solutions of the incompressible laminar boundary layer equations for a plate in shear flow . the two-dimensional steady boundary-layer problem for a flat plate in a shear flow of incompressible fluid is considered . solutions for the boundary- layer thickness, skin friction, and the velocity distribution in the boundary layer are obtained by the karman-pohlhausen technique .  comparison with the boundary layer of a uniform flow has also been made to show the effect of vorticity ."
"one-dimensional transient heat conduction into a double-layer slab subjected to a linear heat input for a small time internal . analytic solutions are presented for the transient heat conduction in composite slabs exposed at one surface to a triangular heat rate .  this type of heating rate may occur, for example, during aerodynamic heating ."
"one-dimensional transient heat flow in a multilayer slab . in a recent contribution to the readers' forum wassermann gave analytic solutions for the temperature in a double layer slab, with a triangular heat rate input at one face, insulated at the other, and with no thermal resistance at the interface .  his solutions were for the three particular cases.. i propose here to give the general solution to this problem, to indicate briefly how it is obtained using the method of reference 2, and to point out that the solutions given by wassermann are incomplete for times longer than the duration of the heat input ."
"the effect of controlled three-dimensional roughness on boundary layer transition at supersonic speeds . experiments were performed in the 12-in. supersonic wind tunnel of the jet propulsion laboratory of the california institute of technology to investigate the effect of three-dimensional roughness elements (spheres) on boundary-layer transition on a tained at local mach numbers of 1.90, 2.71, and 3.67 by varying trip size, position, spacing, and reynolds number per inch . the results indicate that (1) transition from laminar to turbulent flow induced by three-dimensional roughness elements begins when the double row of spiral vortices trailing each element contaminates and breaks down the surrounding field of vorticity, (2) transition appears rather suddenly, becoming more violent with increasing roughness height relative to the boundary-layer thickness, (3) after the breakdown of the vorticity field, the strength of the spiral vortices may still persist in the sublayer of the ensuing turbulent flow, (4) lateral spacing of roughness elements has little effect upon the initial breakdown (contamination) of the laminar flow, and (5) the trip reynolds number where u and v are the velocity and kinematic viscosity at the outer edge of the boundary layer and k is roughness height, such that transition occurs at the roughness position, varies as the position reynolds number to the one-fourth power, viz., where x is trip position ."
"measurements of the effect of two-dimensional and three-dimensional roughness elements on boundary layer transition . in his study of the effect of roughness on transition, h. l. dryden found, on the basis of available data, that the effect of a two-dimensional roughness element such as a /trip wire/ could be represented reasonably well in terms of a functional relation between and, where is the reynolds number of transition based on distance from the leading edge, is the height of the roughness element, and is the boundary-layer displacement thickness at the position of the element .  at his suggestion some additional data were obtained, primarily to extend the range to higher values of, during the course of an investigation of transition on a flat plate conducted at the national bureau of standards .  after the results on the two- dimensional roughness elements were obtained, it appeared to be desirable to see whether a row of three-dimensional roughness elements would behave in the same way ."
"transition studies and skin friction measurements on an insulated flat plate at a mach number of 5.8 . an investigation of transition and skin friction on an insulated flat plate, 5 by 26 in., was made in the galcit 5 by 5 in. hypersonic wind tunnel at a nominal mach number of 5.8 . the phosphorescent lacquer technique was used for transition detection and was found to be in good agreement with total-head rake measurements along the plate surface and pitot boundary- layer surveys .  it was found that the boundary layer was laminar at reynolds numbers of at least 5 x 10 .  transverse contamination caused by the turbulent boundary layer on the tunnel sidewall originated far downstream of the flat plate leading edge at reynolds numbers of 1.5 to 2 x 10, and spread at a uniform angle of 5 compared to 9 degree in low-speed flow . the effect of two-dimensional and local disturbances was investigated .  the technique of air injection into the boundary layer as a means of hastening transition was extensively used . although the onset of transition occurred at reynolds numbers as low as 10, a fully developed turbulent boundary layer was not obtained at reynolds numbers much below 2 x 10 regardless of the amount of air injected . a qualitative discussion of these results is given with emphasis on the possibility of a greater stability of the laminar boundary layer in hypersonic flow than at lower speeds . direct skin-friction measurements were made by means of the floating element technique, over a range of reynolds numbers verified as being laminar over the complete range .  with air injection, turbulent shear was obtained only for reynolds numbers greater than 2 x 10, this value being in good agreement with earlier results of this investigation .  the turbulent skin-friction coefficient was found to be approximately 0.40 of that for incompressible flow for a constant value of r, and 0.46 for an effective reynolds number between 5 and 6 x 10 ."
the theory of the impact tube at low pressure . a theoretical analysis has been made for an impact tube of the relation between free-stream mach number and the impact and free-stream pressures and densities for extremely low pressures . it is shown that the results differ appreciably from the corresponding continuum relations .
